            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To Chriſtians it hath this more to commend it ſelfe: that it bringeth much light to the vnderſtanding of God his worde, and greatlie auaileth to the aduancement of that trueth wherby ſoules are wonne to the Lorde: wherefore I cannot but meruaile at the (ſhall I terme it follie or rather madnes?) of thoſe men, which for the continuance

Let his owne mouth make proofe hereof, in an Oration which he made for <hi>Lucius Flaccus,</hi> beeing at that time accuſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other matters, for detayning great ſummes of gold, ſent yearely vpon deuotion by an vſuall cuſtome out of Italie, and ſome other prouinces of Rome to Ieruſalem. This action of his client, withſtanding the Iewes herein; he greatly commendeth. Ieruſalem, the holie and glorious ſeate of God his ſeruice, hee calleth a ſuſpitious and backebyting Citie. The deuout worſhip of God, and the holy religion of the Iewes, he termeth barbarous ſuperſtition, by great contempt, in regard of the glorie and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtomes of the Roman Empire, &amp; in the end he concludeth them a people not accepted of God: becauſe they had beene ouercome by the enemie and put to their tribute. This was the reckoning which <hi>Tullie</hi> made of them, who by diuine knowledge of God his worde, were the onelie wiſe people in the world:<note place="margin">Deut 4.</note> whereby it appeareth that in his eyes the prophane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of men was deemed more excellent then the wiſedome of God.

no place was left for diuinitie. The knowledge of God his word, was too baſe for that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.

His skill therein he prooued not onely by writing of the liberall ſciences: but alſo alleadging of Poets and other Authors, and fitting their ſayinges to the phraſe of holy ſcripture to make it more plaine; wherof one commeth now to my mind, in his bookes of ſpeeches, taken out of a ſecular Author as hee termeth him. <hi>Et ſcuta Latentia condunt.</hi> They hide the priuie or ſecret lying ſhieldes, meaning ſuch as not before, but after the hyding, lay ſecret and hid.

The ſame father being by ſome blamed, as too much addict to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtudy of Secular knowledge; in an epiſtle of his to on <hi>Magnus</hi> a Roman O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, taketh vpon him the defence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation thereof, by the examples of the beſt and moſt excellent chriſtian fathers before him. I muſt needes therefore greatly commend the wiſedome of our forefathers, in ordering our vniuerſities. VVhere young ſchollers are firſt trained vp in the ſtudies of humanity, before they enter into God his ſchoole: that by that meanes comming furniſhed, and ready ſtored with many helpes from their former learning, they may find a more eaſie waye and ſpeedy courſe in that moſt graue race of diuine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is yet behinde for them to runne. And ſurely ſo it is; and euery one ſhall finde the experience hereof in himſelfe. It is not to be ſpoken, how much and how cleare light, the diligent ſtudy and reading of Latin and Greeke writers; yeeld to the knowledge of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcripture. Which by ſome few examples I will let the reader vnderſtand. The Eleans, in time of peſtilence brought vpon them by exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great abundance of flies; call vpon their God <hi>Myiagrus:</hi> which being by ſacrifice once appeaſed, all thoſe flies forthwith periſh.

That the couer was a cloath hiding the face as well as the heade, appeareth immediatlye after in theſe wordes:</p>

                  <hi>Manantibus adhuc lachrimis, veſteque ab o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re reiecta,</hi> the teares yet trickling downe, &amp; the cloth being caſt away from his mouth, he lift vp his handes to heauen. <hi>Siſigambis</hi> that Kinges mother, was a ſpectacle of rare miſerie.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9226:11"/>
till welcome death made an end of her woes.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Hamans</hi> couered heades, by ſo manie examples, of ſuch as for extreame ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or ſhame of themſelues, not abiding mens ſight, muffled their faces, are cleared of doubt. And herby the vnderſtanding of another place in the 53. Chapter of <hi>Eſay</hi> not a little helped: where our bleſſed Sauiour is compared to one hiding his face. For this, as hath beene prooued, beeing an argument of an heart oppreſſed with griefe, is effectuall and notable, to declare that which immediatly before was ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt: deſpiſed and refuſed of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefe: whereunto the next wordes are theſe: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: That is, to interpret it aright, and as it were hiding the face from vs.</p>
               <p>This here I may not pretermit: that this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie of the couered head is vſed ſometimes in ſcripture, and other where in another ſence. As in the 7. Chapter of <hi>Eſter:</hi> where wee reade of <hi>Hamans</hi> head couered by other againſt his will, to ſignifie that now in the kings wrath hee was appointed to death. For this likewiſe was an ancient cuſtome vſed of diuers Nations, to muffell vp the heads of men condemned to die: or guiltie of ſome grieuous crime deſeruing death. <hi>Polixena</hi> king <hi>Priamus</hi> his daughter, by the ſentence of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and other Princes of Greece adiudged to die, was ledde to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9226:11"/>
ſlaughter of <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> with a vaile ouer her head. As we read in the tragedie of <hi>Euripides,</hi> called <hi>Hecuba. Philotas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Parmenio</hi> one of the chiefe Princes of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d guiltie of high treaſon againſt the king: was brought before him to his anſwer, <hi>Capite velato</hi> hauing his head couered ſaith <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> in his 6. booke. <hi>Feſtus Pompeius,</hi> in the word <hi>Nuptias</hi> ſaith, that the Law commanded his head to bee couered, who had killed his Parente. Laſtlye <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Oration for <hi>C.

               <p>Let me by thy patience (gentle Reader) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to one argument more in this kind, and ſo an end. That which is told by the Euangeliſt of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> eating Locuſts ſeemed incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to ſome, greatly doubting of that kind of meat: and therefore ſuppoſing the place to haue been corrupted by the writers fault, by ſome ſlip ſetting downe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as though his meat had not bin locuſts, but choake peares.</p>
               <p>Thus in their owne conceit they were wiſer than God, by ignorance of trueth witneſſed in diuers prophane Authors. <hi>Galen</hi> vpon <hi>Hipocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> his Aphoriſmes the 2. book, the 18. Chapter is one, declaring there the force, which locuſtes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9226:12"/>
being eaten haue to nouriſh. <hi>Plinie</hi> in the 28 chap. of his 11. book ſaith, that among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> they were counted a pleaſant meate. <hi>Strabo</hi> in his 16. booke of <hi>Geographie,</hi> maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a certaine people which liued of them. <hi>Bellonius</hi> in the 2. booke of his obſeruations, the 88. chapter, teſtifieth from the report of ſome Authors, that in <hi>Africa</hi> they were eaten as dainties: not for Phiſicke, but euen for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thereby proouing it a thing not vncredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſhould eat locuſts. But <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> moſt fullie of all other decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this in his, 4. booke: where hee telleth of certain <hi>Aethiopians</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſt eaters, who neyther eat fiſh, nor cattel, but onely locuſts continually: which at the ſpring time of the yeare they get in great abundance, and ſalt them vp to preſerue them for meate.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue giuen as it were a taſte by this little, out of <hi>Plinie, Pauſanias, Solinus, Horatius, Homer, Sophocles, Herodotus, Euripudes, Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, Plutarch, Quintus Curtius, Feſtus, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius, Cicero, Galen, Strabo:</hi> how great ſeruice Heathen writers doe to the word of God, for opening the true meaning thereof. A taſte I call it in regard of all that which for declaration of other matters might bee ſayd herein, which were the worke of a huge volume, and great toyle.</p>
               <p>Theſe writers then for many partes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9226:12"/>
are diligently to be ſought into, and not as ſome raſh braines imagine, to bee caſt away as vnprofitable in the Lordes ſchoole houſe: but eſpecially for <hi>Daniell</hi> aboue all. In other places they may ſeeme profitable: but heere they are neceſſary: euen by <hi>Hieroms</hi> iudgement, who in a preface to his commentaries on this booke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, the manifold Hiſtories of Greeke and Latine Authors, to bee neceſſary for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſies.</p>
               <p>Theſe helpes therefore I minde to vſe for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding the 4. laſt verſes of the 9. Chapter of <hi>Daniell,</hi> containing an entire propheſie of the eſtate of the holy City after the Iewes returne, from the building thereof, vnto the vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſame by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperor of Rome: and therein of the comming of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Lord of life, aboue 500. yeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Which is a moſt certaine argument of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſedome in <hi>Daniell</hi> from heauen, and a proofe of that which <hi>Balthaſar</hi> had heard, that the ſpirit of the holy Gods was in him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo he foreſhewed many yeares before the deſtruction of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Perſians</hi> ouerthrow by <hi>Alexander;</hi> and the great troubles, which long after that time the Iewes ſuffered vnder <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> All this skill came from God: for the knowledge and foretelling of thinges to come, is that which God onely hath
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9226:13"/>
left in his owne power, and challengeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Prophet <hi>Eſay.</hi> I make knowne thoſe things ſaith, God, which haue not yet hapned. The Heathen Poet <hi>Sophocles</hi> could ſee this, thus writing in the Tragedie of <hi>Aiax</hi> the whip bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Many things ſaith hee may bee knowne of men, when they ſee them come to paſſe: but of thinges to come yet vnſeene, there is no prophet.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that <hi>Porphyrius</hi> a <hi>Tyrian</hi> Philoſopher, a wicked and vngodly Iew, of the kindred and ſect of the Sadduces, an Infidell, an enemie of Chriſt, a hater of God and his word: who wrote fifteene bookes againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to weaken and extenuate the trueth and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſie, deuiſed this ſhift to ſay, that the Iewes long afore <hi>Daniels</hi> time (ſeeing theſe thinges done,) committed them to writing vnder <hi>Daniels</hi> name, thereby to win credit to their bookes.</p>
               <p>This fine deuiſe of <hi>Porphyrie</hi> is nothing elſe but a vaine cauill: For it is well knowne, that the comming of Chriſt is ſpoken of by <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> in diuers places: which can not bee ſaide to haue beene written by the Iewes, who firſt had ſeene the comming of Chriſt, ſeeing that they neyther at that time when hee came, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him, and euer ſince haue beene ſo farre from beleeuing in him, that vſually to this day
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9226:13"/>
they euen curſe his memorie. <hi>Porphyrius</hi> herein hath beene anſwered at large by the learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Methodius, Euſebius, Caeſarienſis,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polinarius,</hi> withſtanding his blaſphemie. And <hi>Hierome</hi> for learning as noble as any, in one ſhort ſentence moſt wittily and pithilie, turneth all his reaſoning againſt <hi>Daniell,</hi> for <hi>Daniell</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelfe. <hi>Porphirii impugnatio teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium veritatis eſt. Tanta enim in hoc Propheta dictorum fides inuenta eſt; vt propterea incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis hominibus videatur non futura dixiſſe: ſed praeterita narraſſe. Porphyrie</hi> his impugning of <hi>Daniell</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hierome</hi>) is a teſtimonie of his trueth: becauſe the ſayings of this Prophet haue beene found ſo certaine, and of ſo great credit, that therefore vnbeleeuers haue iudged him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to tell things paſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeak of things to come. But if there were nothing elſe at all to be ſaide: yet euen this one propheſie of <hi>Daniell</hi> which I haue in hande, touching the deſolation of Ieruſalem, the trueth and certaintie whereof was at the length verified by the euent it ſelfe, at ſuch time as <hi>Titus</hi> deſtroyed the Temple, and Citty: were enough to ſtoppe the aduerſaries mouthes. Yea though all the Infidell <hi>Porphyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> in the world, with all their cunning ſhifting ſtand together, they ſhall neuer be able to auoid the force of this propheſie: but that it muſt needes argue a diuine ſpirit in <hi>Daniell.</hi> For they cannot here ſay, that the Iewes after they had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9226:14"/>
ſeene the Temple deſtroyed by the Romanes, forged a propheſie thereof in <hi>Daniell</hi> his name. Becauſe euen Chriſt himſelfe, in the 24. of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, alleadgeth this propheſie of <hi>Daniel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſolation of the holy Citie, in the flouriſhing time thereof, about 37. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was fulfilled. Whereby it is euident, that this propheſie was commonly knowne &amp; read in the Church of God among the Iewes, as written by <hi>Daniell</hi> long before the euent had ſhewed the trueth thereof: So <hi>Daniell</hi> yet ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a diuine prophet of the Lord, inſpired with heauenly knowledge of thinges to come from aboue; and ſeeing that in one thing truely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told this is prooued of him, there is no cauſe at all to doubt of the reſt.</p>
               <p>This is a ſure foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diuinitie, a ſound ſtay of religion, a ſtrong prop of faith to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the vndoubted trueth of GOD his word, a mightie vpholder of the prouidence of God againſt all the Atheiſtes and Epicures of the world: Which <hi>Joſephus</hi> verie well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and in the end of his 10. booke of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſputing againſt this kind of men, fetcheth his reaſon from the ſure truth of <hi>Daniels</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies. The errour ſaith hee of the Epicureans hereby is reprooued, which take Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in gouerning things out of this life, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the world to be carried by his owne force without a guide or ouerſeer. Wherefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9226:14"/>
                  <hi>Daniels</hi> propheſies, I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the fooliſhnes of thoſe men, which deny that God hath any care of mens affaires. For how could it come to paſſe, that the euent ſhould anſwere his prophecies, if all thinges in the world were done by chance. <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo in the firſt book of his inſtitutions: Doth not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi> ſaith he, ſo propheſie of thinges to come by the ſpace of 600. yeares, as though he wrote an Hiſtorie of things alreadie done, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne? Good men by the diligent medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof ſhall bee abundantly furniſhed to quiet the barking of the vngodly: for this eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is clearer, then that it can be ſubiect to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauils.</p>
               <p>This was the iudgement of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> &amp; <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> againſt Atheiſts and prophane Epicures, to their ſhame and ouerthrow: taken from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of <hi>Daniels</hi> foreſhewing things to come. Euen this one prophecie of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes, is a verie hammer to beate them downe to the ground, and a wier ſcourge as it were to teare them all in peeces: And therefore of all true Chriſtians to be had in great reuerence, and the vnderſtanding therof to bee deſired as pearles, and diligently ſought for, as hid treaſure. To the finding out hereof two thinges are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite: the one is a iuſt account of the times: the other, a true interpretation of the wordes in the originall tongue. If wee faile in either of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9226:15"/>
theſe, there is no hope to knowne what <hi>Daniell</hi> meant by his weekes: For neither good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation alone is enough without exact chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie; nor this without the other ſerueth much to purpoſe. The ſundring of theſe two things, which muſt needes ſtand together, hath beene the cauſe of ſuch turning and toſſing this excellent peece of Scripture in ſo many mens heades, ſo many waies: therefore in theſe two thinges eſpecially ſhall be the imployment of my paines; if happily thereby this noble text of Scripture may receaue ſome light to the clearer perceauing thereof.</p>

Except peraduenture ſome to ſhew the fineneſſe of their wit by Sophiſtrie, might ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill againſt it. For the better vnderſtanding of that which hath bin, and ſhall hereafter be ſaid of Olympiads; it ſhal not be amiſſe here to ſhew what is meant thereby.</p>
               <p>Olympia was a certaine place of Greece, where games of running, wreſtling, leaping &amp; ſuch like were inſtituted by <hi>Hercules</hi> in honor of <hi>Iupiter Olympius,</hi> wherof the place was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Olympia, and the games Olympiads, &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limpiac games, &amp; the ſports of Olympia, which after <hi>Hercules</hi> for a long time beeing diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, were at the length renewed againe by <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitus</hi> King of that countrie, about ſeauen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſeauentie and fiue yeares before the birth of our Sauiour Chriſt. Beeing ſo reuiued, they were from that time forward continued, by the ſpace of a thouſand yeres and more after, euery foure yeares in ſommer, about the month of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolemnized. This foure yeares ſpace was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Olympias. By theſe Olympiads the Grecians numbred their yeares, counting from that time wherein they were begun againe by <hi>Iphitus.</hi> As appeareth by <hi>Velleius Paterculus, Solinus, Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Pauſanius, Cenſorinus:</hi> who all referre the beginning thereof to <hi>Iphitus:</hi> neyther for this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9226:16"/>
matter that I know of amongſt writers, is there any doubt at all. Beyond <hi>Iphitus</hi> I cannot war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant any certaine account of yeeres among the heathen, greatly meruailing at the folly of thoſe men, who buſie themſelues in ſearching for ſure knowledge by ordered times, many ages before.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian Prince not long agoe ſtanding much vpon his parentage, by this kinde of men was ſeduced. A trifling Courtier perceiuing his humor, made him beleeue that his petigree in ancient race of royall blood, might be fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Noa</hi> his Arke: wherewith being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted, forthwith he laid all buſines aſide, and gaue himſelfe wholly to the ſearche of this thing ſo earneſtly, that hee ſuffered none to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt him whoſoeuer, no not Embaſſadors themſelues, which were ſent to him about moſt waightie affaires. Many meruailed heereat, but none durſt ſpeake their mind: till at the length his Cooke, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vſed ſometime in ſtead of a foole, told him that the thing which hee went about, was nothing for his honor: for now ſaith he, I worſhip your Maieſtie as a God; but if we goe once to <hi>Noas</hi> Arke, wee muſt there your ſelfe and I both be a kinne.</p>
               <p>This ſaying of his fooliſh Cooke caſt him in a dumpe, and ſtayed the heat of his earneſt ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and brought him to a better mind, from his vaine error in deceiueable times, farre beyond
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9226:17"/>
the compaſſe of truth: which, as before hath bin ſhewed, was limited from the firſt Olimpiad downeward, within theſe limits of time by the teſtimonie of <hi>Varro, Affricanus, Cenſorinus,</hi> &amp; the Iudgements of manie other learned men in all ages, being certaine and void of error, is the reach of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes: yea to come nearer home by 200, yeares and more, within that part thereof, which by the learning, wiſedome, and knowledge of excellent men, hath beene made moſt famous: that is to ſay from the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Monarchie, in the firſt yeare of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the ſecond of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> Emperour of Roome; wherein the Cittie of Ieruſalem was deſtroyed, and the Iewes common wealth ouerthrowne, within the liſts and compaſſe whereof, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of this Propheſie is contained, euen <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaldus</hi> himſelfe, though an aduerſarie of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued Grecians Chronologie, in his 2. booke, and 2. chapter: where hee ſaith, that before the times of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Greek Hiſtories haue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: ſeemeth to acknowledge ſome truth of Hiſtorie afterward: whereof he giueth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his age, were the 7. ſages of Greece liuing together, one of them beeing <hi>Colon</hi> the Athenian, acquainted with <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of Lydia, who fought againſt <hi>Cyrus.</hi> This whole ſpace from the beginning of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his raigne, to the deſtruction of the holy Cittie by <hi>Titus,</hi> containeth 629. yeares from the Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9226:17"/>
wherein <hi>Cyrus</hi> began, to the ſame ſeaſon of that yeare, wherein Ieruſalem, Temple, and Citie was ſet on fire. For the Perſian kings raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſpace of 230. yeares. From the death of the laſt King of Perſia to the birth of Chriſt, were about 328. yeares and a halfe. And thence to the deſolation of Ieruſalem ſet on fire 70. and a halfe with two monthes, or there about.</p>
               <p>The proofe of theſe three partes, in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I minde to follow. But before I come to the right path, as it were of the Perſian times: It ſhall be requiſite, firſt to take certaine ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blockes out of the readers way: whereof one is the opinion of the Hebrewe writers, who by great reaſon ſhould haue been skilfull in theſe matters, in regard of their deliuerance from ſlauiſh captiuitie, and many other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits graunted vnto them by the Perſian Kinges. Some of theſe writers reading in the 11. of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi> of a fourth king to raigne in Perſia; and preſently after a propheſie of the ouerthrow of that Empire by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great: thought there could not poſſibly be any more than foure in all. The names forſooth of theſe foure they gather from <hi>Eſdras,</hi> making mention in his fourth chapter of <hi>Cyrus, Aſſuerus, Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes, Darius,</hi> &amp; then after in his ſeuenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of another <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> Now leſt that <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſhould ſeeme by fiue names, to diſſent from <hi>Daniell,</hi> ſpeaking onely of foure kings, they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9226:18"/>
make the firſt <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to be all one with <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> and becauſe the laſt king of Perſia, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome by <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the Hiſtories of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers nations was knowne by the name <hi>Darius:</hi> to make all good, they ſay he had likewiſe two names, one <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> the other <hi>Darius.</hi> This was <hi>Aben Ezras</hi> opinion, one of the wittieſt &amp; beſt learned amongſt them. <hi>R. Moſes</hi> a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard and Prieſt, came ſomewhat nearer to the trueth, parting theſe two names <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> mentioned in the 4. of <hi>Ezra,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two ſeuerall Kinges, and ſo by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were fiue in number. Others, as <hi>R. Sadiah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham Dauiſon,</hi> counting <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> fourth king not from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Mede incluſiuely, leaue onely three kinges for the Perſian Monarchie to runne out vnder them: that is, firſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and after him <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> the third and laſt <hi>Darius,</hi> the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sonne of <hi>Eſter</hi> by <hi>Aſſuerus.</hi> But howe can this agree with <hi>Eſdras</hi> in whome fiue names of the Perſian Emperours are recorded? Well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſay they, for <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> &amp; the firſt <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> were one and the ſame. And likewiſe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> by <hi>Abraham Dauiſons</hi> opinion. Now concerning the yeares of their raigne. <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> maketh this recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his three former kinges yeares. <hi>Cyrus</hi> to haue continued three yeares, <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, <hi>Darius</hi> twelue, the reſt of that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9226:18"/>
expired in <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> whoſe 32. is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ſcripture: but <hi>Dauiſon</hi> giueth to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> three, to <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> ſixteene, to <hi>Darius</hi> 32. In whoſe ſecond (as he ſayeth) the Temple was builded, and himſelfe ſlaine 30. yeares after by <hi>Alexander:</hi> But the moſt generall and receaued opinion ſeemeth to bee that which is declared in their Hebrew Chronicles <hi>Rabba</hi> and <hi>Zota:</hi> that the whole time of the Perſian kingdome was 52. yeares, counted from the firſt of <hi>Darius</hi> the Mede: whereof 18. were ſpent before the building of the Temple, and 34. after.</p>
               <p>This is the Rabbinicall ſtuffe of the chiefe Maſters of the Hebrewes, being at ods betwixt themſelues, &amp; diſſenting from others, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without cauſe doth <hi>Pererius</hi> in his commentaries vppon <hi>Daniell</hi> (ſpeaking of this chronologie of theirs) ſay, that it is falſe, fained, full of faultes, toyes, ignorance, abſurditie, and vnconſtancie, and altogether ridiculous, as it is indeede. <hi>Temporarius</hi> is more ſharpe &amp; bitter againſt them. The Thalmudiſts, Cabbaliſts, and Rabbines (ſaith he) are blinde in the Perſian times, and the writinges of the Iewes herein plaine proofes of pittifull ignorance in them: who can reade the chronologies of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, their Seder Olam Rabba, their Seder O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam Zota, their Hiſtoricall Cabbala, without laughing? Therefore the knowledge of times is not to bee fetched from the dotings of theſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9226:19"/>
men being more blinde than moules. All this which they ſay is true I confeſſe: The Church of God for other matters is much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Hebrew Rabbines, beeing great helps vnto vs for vnderſtanding holy ſcripture in many places, as well of the new teſtament as the olde: but touching the knowledge of the Perſian Empire, wherein they ſhould haue bin moſt cunning, they were as blinde as beetles, no light herein amongſt them for knowledge to be ſeene, but darkenes for ignorance enough and too much. The reaſon whereof is, that they wanted the key as it were of prophane Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſecular learning, to vnlocke the ſhut &amp; hid meaning of <hi>Daniels</hi> oracles. Without the which by ſcripture alone it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer be opened. Some of them not diſdaining to read the Latine and Greeke hiſtories, by the direction of theſe guides went not ſo far aſtray. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities prooueth it. This may ſuffice to cleare the right way from the firſt ſtumbling blocke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Annius Viterbienſis</hi> hath been another to the downfall of many, ſetting forth certaine ancient chronicles, vnder the names of <hi>Beroſus, Manetho,</hi> and <hi>Philo;</hi> and together with them, one other of the Perſian Monarchie, fathered vpon <hi>Metaſthenes</hi> an ancient Perſian: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he reckoneth the kinges of the Perſian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, eight in number, in this order: Firſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> then ancient <hi>Artaxerxes Aſſuerus:</hi> After

Theſe books thus commended with ſuch glorious titles of noble and ancient Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, were in great requeſt and much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of many learned men, and excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, for a long time embracing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the only true Chronologie of all other, and alleadging their authorities as oracles from heauen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and ſure: beeing indeede nothing elſe but masking counterfaites, couered with the glorious titles of auncient and famous writers. At the length they were found out and detected by the cunning of diuers skilfull men: who ſearched vnto them and ſifted them nearely. <hi>Volaterranus</hi> in his fourteenth book, giueth no credit vnto them. <hi>Lewes Viues</hi> in his preface to the eighteenth booke of <hi>Auguſtine de ciuitate dei,</hi> calleth them monſters, and dregges, &amp; fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous bookes of vncertaine Authors. <hi>Gerardus Mercator</hi> counteth of them no better than Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and falſe and forged writinges. <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger</hi> inueyeth ſharply againſt them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, terming them lies, dreames, forged and fained ſtuffe. And the Author thereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he calleth vnlearned and ſhameles. <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Vargara, Beatus Rhenanus, Functius, Bero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldus,

Pererius,</hi> and <hi>Temporarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe haue vncaſed theſe counterfait Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and taken the viſardes from their faces: But eſpeciallie aboue all the reſt, the two laſt named <hi>Pererius</hi> &amp; <hi>Temporarius,</hi> haue laied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> open to the wide world, to appeare that which in very deed they were.

               <p>This is <hi>Pererius</hi> his cenſure, no otherwiſe in my iudgement then ſuch forgerie and falſehood hath deſerued: whereof take this as a manifeſt argument. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in the tenth booke of his Antiquities the 11. Chapter writeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>An other much like vnto it hath bin the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited fancie of <hi>Mathew Beroald</hi> in the thirde booke of his Chronologie the eight Chapter, ſetting downe the Perſian Kinges in this order. The firſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the next <hi>Aſſuerus Artaxerxes,</hi> the third <hi>Darius Aſſirius,</hi> the fourth <hi>Artaxerx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Pius,</hi> the fift <hi>Xerxes:</hi> And then after him the other ſixe in order, as they haue beene declared and named by other. Of theſe eleuen Kinges how many yeares particularlie euerie one raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is vncertaine ſaith <hi>Beroaldus;</hi> but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the whole time of all was 130. yeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the 3. yeare of the 80. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad, &amp; the 295 of Rome. This is <hi>Beroaldus</hi> his opinion, for the kings and time of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: much like that of <hi>Annius.</hi> In maner it is more honeſt, beeing not fathered on other: in matter as abſurde and ridiculous, if not more; making more kinges, and fewer yeares: thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch as neuer were knowne, and fayning names which neuer were heard of. For where was <hi>Aſſuerus Artaxerxes, Darius Aſſirius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes Pius,</hi> euer ſpoken of by any
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9226:21"/>
Author of credit diuine or prophane? Who euer beſides himſelf, once dreamed of an <hi>Artaxerx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Pius</hi> to be Father to <hi>Xerxes?</hi> Or that <hi>Xerxes</hi> made warre againſt Greece before his Fathers death? <hi>Aeſchilus</hi> a learned Poet, who floriſhed euen in thoſe verie times, in his Tragedie called <hi>Perſa,</hi> might ſoone haue taught him a better leſſon: rayſing his father <hi>Darius</hi> long before dead, out of his graue to tell newes. Doeth not ſuch ſtuffe as this deſerue the tearmes of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, dregs, dreames, lyes, toyes, as well as that opinion of <hi>Annius,</hi> which euen <hi>Beroaldus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe reprooueth? Is it not worthy of ſuch a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, as that wherewith <hi>Pererius</hi> biddeth <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his Chronologie adew?</p>
               <p>Theſe be the opinions, which in the courſe of Chronologie, haue to diuers learned men, been occaſions of error.

To be ſhort, it reached from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia all a long, ſo neare Greece and Europe, that there was no land left to part them, but the Sea called Aegeum. And that in ſome place ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as a bridge hath beene made ouer it from brinke to brinke, not a mile long, with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al recourſe and traffique betweene them.

               <p>The times therof, by the ſinguler knowledge &amp; vertues of excellent me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were no leſſe noble.

Many of theſe were borne, &amp; dwelling in thoſe places which were vnder the Perſian gouernment; and payed tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto them.</p>
               <p>In theſe places and times ſo furniſhed, and bewtified with theſe worthy ornaments, marke the wayes and meanes, whereby the kings of Perſian made their names known &amp; preſerued their memorie. By proclamation whereof we haue an example in the firſt of <hi>Eſra.</hi> Thus ſayeth <hi>Cyrus</hi> king of Perſia and ſo forth. By letters to and fro, wherof are to be ſeene in the ſame book and <hi>Thucidides,</hi> and other: making mention by name who ſent them, and to whom. By immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities &amp; priuiledges as in the ſeuenth of <hi>Eſra.</hi> By ambaſſage whereof manie examples are reade in <hi>Herodotus.

The ſame king going to war againſt Scithia, erected at Boſphorus two pillers with two inſcriptions, one in Greeke, the

other in the Aſſyrian language, thereon engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; declaring the Nations which went with him: And at the riuer <hi>Toarus</hi> in Thracia, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this inſcription: HITHER CAME DARIVS THE SONNE OF HYSTASPES KING OF THE PERSIANS, LEADING HIS ARMIE AGAINST THE SCYTHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANS, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> declareth in <hi>Melpomine.</hi> By Cities and Riuers called of their names <hi>Cyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> of <hi>Cyrus, Cambyſene</hi> of <hi>Cambyſes, Xerxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> of <hi>Xerxes; Cyrus</hi> a riuer in Scythia, &amp; <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi> an other.

Laſtly, by their Tombes, teſtifying their names to the worlde after their death: being a thing deſired of al euen of meane account, and willinglie yeelded of kinde poſteritie, that the memorie of their name may endure, and not die with themſelues. <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> in the fifteenth booke of his Geographie from <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> and <hi>Oneſicritus,</hi> recordeth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9226:24"/>
that the toombe of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was found by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> ſo many yeares after his death preſerued, with an inſcription teſtifying who he was. And that <hi>Darius</hi> alſo had the like memoriall.</p>
               <p>The names then of the Perſian kings could not poſſibly bee hid, by ſo many meanes being made knowne in flouriſhing times, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ages, and places of knowledge, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all their Courtes frequented with many noble Grecians, for vertue and birth. <hi>Hippias,</hi> and <hi>Demaratus,</hi> whereof the one had been king of Sparta; the other tyrant of Athens: <hi>Metiochus</hi> the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Miltiades, Democedes</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Phiſition of Croton in Italie, who healed king <hi>Darius</hi> and his wife <hi>Atoſſa</hi> of grieuous paines, and diuers other which were too long to rehearſe, to omit many braue ſoldiers of Greece ſeruing them in their warres.</p>
               <p>Now let the Reader vſe his skill for choice of the names, and number of the kinges betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Xerxes.</hi> Whether with <hi>Beroaldus</hi> he wil haue theſe three; <hi>Aſſuerus Artaxerxes, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Aſſyrius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes Pius,</hi> in ſo many ages neuer knowne or read of in any author of reckoning: or only theſe two; <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> and <hi>Darius Hiſtaspis</hi> from <hi>Theagines</hi> of Rhegium, and <hi>Hecateus</hi> of Miletus, ſtorie writers: the one vnder <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> the other vnder <hi>Darius,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto vs by continual ſucceſſion, from age to age, by the ſpace of two thouſand yeares and

more, by the carefull diligence of the beſt hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers, that euer haue bin in the world, without any diſagreement or controuerſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. Thus much for the kings now concerning their yeares.</p>
               <p>That the beginning of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was the firſt yeare of the 55. Olympiad, is agreed of all: the firſt yeare of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſayeth <hi>Codomon</hi> in his chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles; of all writers is applied to the firſt of the 55. Olympiad. <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger</hi> prooueth it by two teſtimonies in his fift booke <hi>de emendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one temporum.</hi> How manie ancient and learned writers ſo euer ſaith <hi>Scaliger,</hi> haue accounted times, euery one of them hath caſt the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the firſt of the 55. Olympiad. <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Siculus, Thallus, Castor, Polybius, Phlegon;</hi> as the moſt auncient and learned Author <hi>Tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> writeth. <hi>Africanus</hi> alſo in <hi>Euſebius</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ſame in theſe wordes. After the 70. yeres of captiuitie, <hi>Cyrus</hi> raigned ouer the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians that yeare wherin the 55. Olympiad was celebrated, as may appeare by the Libraries of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and the Hiſtories of <hi>Thallus</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,</hi> and beſides of <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Phlegon,</hi> yea of other alſo who regarded Olympiads, for the time is agreed vpon of all. This therefore for the beginning of the Perſian Monarchie beeing ſo generally teſtified, may ſuffice. If any here doe aske in what part of that yeare <hi>Cyrus</hi> began to raigne, it is gathered from the ſame <hi>Africanus</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:9226:25"/>
probablie in the third booke of his Chronicles: where, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> teſtifieth of him, in his tenth booke <hi>de praeparat. Euang.</hi> hee reckoned from the firſt Olympiad to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> 217. yeres. Which is not otherwiſe true, except <hi>Cyrus</hi> begin to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of that yeare. Againe, in the fift booke of his Chronicles, making the fourth yeare of the 83. Olympiad, the fifteenth of the Perſian Monarchie; as we read in the ſame <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> his eight booke <hi>de demonſtrat. Euang.</hi> he leaueth the beginning of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the firſt yeare of the 55. Olympiad, nere the end thereof: as euery one may eaſily perceiue.</p>
               <p>The beginning thus made manifeſt, wee are now further to ſearch the end of that Empire: Which beeing once likewiſe founde maketh knowne the continuance thereof. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great was the man which ouerthrew that Empire: whoſe death by the teſtimonies of <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in the ſeuenteenth book of his Hiſtoricall Liberarie, <hi>Arrhianus</hi> in his ſeuenth booke, and <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Chronicles, is ſet in the hundred and fourteenth Olympiad. What ſay I <hi>Diodorus, Arrhiamus, Euſebius,</hi> when as all, whoſoeuer wrote of thoſe times, agree here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by <hi>Gerardus Mercator</hi> his report in his Chronicles? The death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſaith he, of all writers is noted to haue happened in the hundred and fourteenth Olympiad, when <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſias</hi> was chiefe ruler at Athens. If this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9226:25"/>
of <hi>Mercator</hi> be of leſſe importance, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the late time wherein he liued; <hi>Ioſephus</hi> an ancient Author of credit and skill, in his firſt book againſt <hi>Appian</hi> beareth him record, very conſtantly affirming this to be verified by the vniuerſall conſent of all writers; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> died in the hundred and fourteenth Olympiad. This is ſomewhat, but not altogether inough, except we can learne in what part of that firſt yeare of the ſame Olympiad hee died. For the knowledge of this we are beholding to <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi> Whoſe words are theſe in his eight booke <hi>de demonſtratione Euangelij.</hi>

                  </gap>. That is in Engliſh thus much, <hi>Alexander</hi> ended his life in the beginning of the hundred &amp; four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Olympiad.</p>
               <p>Making then our account fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fiue &amp; fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Olympiad, to the beginning of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred &amp; fourteenth, wherein the light of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia was put out; wee finde the ſpace of two hundred thirtie and ſixe yeares between appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not by weake coniectures, friuolous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, or trifling toyes, but a ſtrong conſent of writers, which as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his 1. book againſt <hi>Appian,</hi> is a ſure token of vndoubted truth; when they all agree. Six yeares and about three quarters before <hi>Alexanders</hi> death, the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had beene by him ſubdued, receiuing as great a blow, as euer before other Nations had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9226:26"/>

This was the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie yeare of the Perſian ouerthrow, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full month of their fall, and the ſorrowfull day of king <hi>Darius</hi> his vndoing, who after this vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was contemned of his men, forſaken of his ſouldiers, betraied by his ſeruants, made a ſlaue to his Captaines, in moſt baſe manner ſhut vp within a vile wagge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, couered with filthie skins, as it were in a priſon, and ſo carried about at their pleaſure. In the end they ſtabbed him with many woundes, and left him for dead, ſlew the waggener, thruſt the beaſts through with darts, which wanting a guide ſtrayed from the high way about halfe a mile. Where one of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> ſouldiers going to drinke, by chance eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the waggen, &amp; comming vnto it found the king now drawing on; who firſt craued of him a little water.

that handfull of the Grecians had like ſucceſſe: a great number was ſlaine; many wounded, the reſt put to flight. <hi>Xerxes</hi> maugred, thus ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a few from paſſing further into Greece, was at his wits ende, till ſuch time as one of that countrey had informed him of another way, by which ſome of the armie came vpon the backe of <hi>Leonides,</hi> and ſo incloſed him on both ſides, which <hi>Leonides</hi> hauing intelligence of by a ſecret friend a little before, ſent all the reſt of his companie home ſauing fiue hundred. Theſe he encouraged, and the more to enable them for battell, exhorted them to dine before, with reſolued mindes to take their ſupper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead. Which done, and night come, they inuaded the Perſian campe, came to the kings Pauilion, ſlew all that were in it, wandred to and fro ſeeking the king, who a little before had got himſelfe away, and killing on both ſides as they went. The Perſians in the darke not diſcerning the matter, were greatly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, ran out of their tents they wiſt not whether, fearing nothing ſo much as this, that the whole power of Greece had ſet vpon them.

               <p>The battailes wherein <hi>Xerxes</hi> had this wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come into Greece, many olde writers with great agreement refer to the beginning of the ſeuentie and fiue Olympiad. <hi>Diodorus</hi> in his eleuenth booke writeth, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> warred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Greece in the firſt yeare of the ſeuentie and fiue Olympiad, <hi>Callias</hi> then being Maior of Athens. <hi>Dyoniſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> in the beginning of his ninth booke agreeth hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; naming that very yeare of the ſame Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, and the ſame Maior of Athens, for the time of <hi>Xerxes</hi> fighting againſt Greece. <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> alſo in his Chronicles hath a plaine confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hereof, referring to the firſt yeare of this ſeuentie and fiue Olympiad, that battaile wherin <hi>Xerxes</hi> his power by ſea fought againſt the Athenians, and tooke a moſt ſhamefull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow. <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> in the life of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> writeth, that in the time of <hi>Callias</hi> his gouernement at Athens, in the firſt yeare of the ſeuentie fiue Olympiad, the Poet <hi>Euripides</hi> was borne; <hi>Suidas</hi> nameth the very day of his birth, euen that wherein <hi>Xerxes</hi> his nauie was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Grecians at Salamis. The ſame <hi>Laertius</hi> reporteth from ancient Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> being borne in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty Olympiad, was twentie yeares old when <hi>Xerxes</hi> paſſed into Greece, and <hi>Callias</hi> ruled at
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9226:31"/>
Athens: thereby giuing vs to vnderſtand that by the receiued opinion of former ages, <hi>Xerxes</hi> inuading Greece, and <hi>Callias</hi> his Maioraltie at Athens, fell to the firſt yeare of the 75. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad. In like manner <hi>Pindarus,</hi> borne in the 65. Olympiad, and at <hi>Xerxes</hi> his warre fortie yeare olde by <hi>Suidas</hi> record, approueth the trueth of that account. Who ſo liſt to make triall ſhall eaſilie ſee an exact agreement betwixt this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad and the yeares of <hi>Xerxes</hi> before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed. <hi>Africanus</hi> in the fift booke of his Chronicles, affirming that the fourth of the 83. Olympiad, was the 20. of <hi>Artaxerxes Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> and the 115. of the Perſian kingdome, maketh all good.</p>
               <p>The Athenians after the Perſians ouerthrow, and <hi>Xerxes</hi> his flight out of Grecia grew migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hauing by their great nauie obtained the rule of the ſea, and ſubdued many people of Greece. Whereupon the Lacedemonians, who dwelt in that part of Greece which was called Peloponneſus, ſuſpecting their power, and fled vnto for ayde, tooke parte againſt them; which in the ende was the occaſion of that long and fierce warre betweene the Athenians and the Lacedemonians, called the Peloponneſian war. The one people ſpoyling by ſea, the other by land: ſo that by this means the Grecians which moſt gloriouſlie had triumphed in many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes ouer the mightie Monarchs of the world,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9226:31"/>
were now brought low, and pittifullie waſted in moſt lamentable manner, turning their forces from the common enemy to their ruine againſt themſelues: the continuance, beginning, and ende of this warre is moſt exactly deſcribed by <hi>Thucidides</hi> an Athenian Gentleman, the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof, who flouriſhed in that time and ſaw the warre with his eyes, from the beginning to the end; yea was a chiefe captaine therein, a writer for certaine trueth of hiſtorie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reckoning of time moſt excellent, and of ſuch account in the ages following, that euen the beſt followed him, and gaue credite vnto him. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> the famous Orator of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens tooke paines to coppie out his bookes eyght times with his owne hand, as <hi>Lucian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth. This exact hiſtoriographer, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of his ſecond booke, telleth that this warre begunne in the fifteenth yeare of the league, which after the taking of Eubaea was made for thirtie yeares to come, Aeneſias being then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior of Sparta, and <hi>Pythodorus</hi> of Athens, and the yeare of their Maioraltie now within two moneths expired, in the beginning of the ſpring. For the better vnderſtanding of theſe wordes, concerning the taking of Eubaea, and the thirtie yeares league, I will briefely touch the hiſtorie.</p>
               <p>Eubaea was an Iland neere vnto Greece, in the Aegean ſea, which hauing been ſubiect and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9226:32"/>
tributarie to the Athenians; at the length ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their opportunity, by reaſon of a great ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Athenians in Baeotia, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians holding againſt them; by which their power was greatly weakened, fell from them, refuſing to ſerue them, or pay them tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any longer. For this cauſe <hi>Pericles</hi> a noble man of Athens, was ſent againſt them with a great hoaſt, who once againe ſubdued them. And a little after their returne from Eubaea, now the ſecond time by <hi>Pericles</hi> ſo conquered; a league was made betweene the Athenians and the Lacedemonians, to endure for thirtie yeares following. The articles and couenants of this league were grauen in a pillar of braſſe ſet in Olympia, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> recordeth in the firſt of his Eliacx, where hee alſo declareth the time thereof to be the third yeare of that Olympiad, wherein <hi>Criſo</hi> of Himaera won the race. Now that that Olympiad wherein <hi>Criſo</hi> of Himaera won the race, was the 83. we haue the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> in the ende of his tenth of Roman antiquities, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the eleuenth. Hereof it followeth by <hi>Thucidides</hi> compared with other writers; that the Peloponneſian ſturres began in the firſt yere of the 87. Olympiad; for that is iuſt the 15. yeare from the third of the 83. wherein the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares league was made. Againe, for cleerer confirmation hereof, <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9226:32"/>
twelfth booke hath left in recorde, that the yeare of <hi>Pythodorus</hi> his Maioraltie at Athens, in the ende whereof <hi>Thucidides</hi> beginneth that war, was the firſt of the 87. Olympiad.</p>
               <p>This therefore I holde for a certaine trueth, that the beginning of the Peloponneſian warre happened in the firſt yeare of the 87. Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, toward the end thereof, about the beginning of Aprill, ſo as the Olympicke exerciſes of that yeare, were ſolemnized the ſommer before go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and the 4. 8. 12. 16. 20. 24. 28. ſommers of that war were Olympicke yeares; which of the fourth and the twelfth is plainly teſtified by <hi>Thucidides</hi> himſelfe in the third and fift bookes of his hiſtorie. In the ſeuenth yeare of this war <hi>Thucidides</hi> telleth, that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> died in winter; which for the certaine knowledge of the Perſian times, is a moſt excellent place, a ſure fort, a ſound argument, a cleere teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, a ſtrong proofe from him, which liued at that time, was as olde as the thing it ſelfe which he telleth, ſaw the effect with his eyes, ſtudied from his heart to ſet forth the trueth. If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer account be agreeable to this teſtimonie of <hi>Thucidides,</hi> as it is moſt preciſely, I ſee no cauſe why it may not triumph ouer all aduerſaries, how powerfull and how well learned ſoeuer. Marke then the agreement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xerxes</hi> his 21. wherein he dyed, was ſaide to be the fourth of the 78. Olympiad. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:9226:33"/>
raigned 40. which being numbred from that yeare of his fathers death, bring vs iuſt to the fourth of the Olympian, and the ſeuenth of the Peloponneſian war; the ſet time of <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> his death by <hi>Thucidides:</hi> who beſt of all other writers now extant in the world, knew the certaine trueth of it, and for credite in this matter, hee hath none comparable vnto him. The ſame <hi>Thucidides</hi> making the 20. of the Peloponneſian war, to be the thirteenth of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Nothus,</hi> confirmeth it once againe. For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thirteene of that war vnder <hi>Darius,</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnder <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> that number is made vp. The continuance and ende of this war, by the ſame <hi>Thucidides</hi> is ſhewed in his fift booke: where hee declareth the whole time of that war to haue been 27. yeares, to the ouerthrow of the Athenian Empire, and the taking of their hauen Pyreus by the Lacedemonians, and their aſſociates. Of this had gone a Propheſie long before in many mens mouthes: which himſelf with his owne eares many times had heard; that it ſhould endure thriſe nine yeares: which is confirmed by <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> very plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirming that war to haue laſted 27. yeares, in two places: firſt in his twelfth booke, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the beginning of that war, and after in his thirteenth booke, ſpeaking of the laſt yeare thereof, which hee ſaith was the laſt of the 93. Olympiad, as in deede it was: for 27. yeares ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9226:33"/>
to the firſt of the 87. Olympiad, wherein it began, make an end of it in the fourth of the 93.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Thucidides</hi> followed <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who from the one and twentie yeare of that warre where <hi>Thucidides</hi> left, continued in writing the courſe of that Hiſtorie to the ende: a man liuing in thoſe dayes carefull of the truth, and skilfull in Hiſtorie, commended euen by <hi>Bero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldus</hi> himſelfe, though otherwiſe an aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the true ancient Chronologie, and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of thoſe times: In the fifth Chapter of his fourth book, <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſaith <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> writeth that the gouernment of Athens was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a few in that Olympick yeare, wherein <hi>Crocinus</hi> the Theſſalian won the race, but which Olympiad it was in number hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not: Which if he who then liued, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelfe for ſeruice had done; hee had rid vs of much trouble. Let vs ſee therefore what help is giuen by this excellent writer to eaſe vs herein.</p>
               <p>In his firſt booke of Greeke affaires, this firſt hee ſetteth downe verie flatlie, that the yeare wherein <hi>Enarchippus</hi> at Sparta, and <hi>Enctemo</hi> at Athens were Maiors, was the firſt of the 43. Olympiad, wherein <hi>Eubotas</hi> the Cyrenian won the race, and a new game of yoaked hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes called <hi>Synoris</hi> was firſt ordayned, at that time won by <hi>Enagoras</hi> of Elis, where leſt anie
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9226:34"/>
might think <hi>Xenophon</hi> to haue bin deceiued, we haue for further warrant, the teſtimonie of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi> in the firſt booke of <hi>Eliacx.</hi> The running (ſaith hee) of two horſes of ripe age called <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris,</hi> was inſtituted in the 93. Olympiad, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Euagoras</hi> the Elian got the victorie. Nowe this being made plaine by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchippus</hi> was gouernour of Sparta in the firſt yeare of the 93. Olympiad; if it can bee further ſhewed by him, in what yere of the Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian warre the ſame <hi>Enarchippus</hi> ruled at Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta; we ſhall eaſilie perceiue by euident directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from this worthie Author, to what yeare of euery Olympiad, the beginning, midſt, &amp; end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and euery particular yeare of that war ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth.</p>
               <p>To ſhew this we haue a Catalogue of all the chiefe Spartan Magiſtrates, which bare Office in euery yeare of that warre called Ephori, ſet downe by <hi>Xenophon</hi> in order by their names, in the ſecond booke of his Greeke Hiſtorie in theſe words. The firſt (ſaith <hi>Xenophon</hi>) was <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſias</hi> vnder whome the warre began in the 15. yeare of the 30. yeares league, made after the taking of <hi>Eubaea.</hi> After him ſucceeded theſe, <hi>Boraſidas, Iſanor, Soſtratidas, Exarchus, Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus, Agenidas, Onomacles, Zeuxippus, Pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Pleiſtolas, Cleiomachus, Ilarchus, Leon, Chae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridas, Pateſiades, Cleoſthenes, Lycarius, Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus, Onomantius, Alexippidas, Miſgolaidas,

Iſias, Aracus, Enarchippus, Pantacles, Piteas, Archytas, Endius.</hi> In whoſe time <hi>Lyſander</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing done the exploits before rehearſed ſayled home. By this Catalogue of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Maiors, it is manifeſt that <hi>Xenophon</hi> for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of time, in this warre agreeth moſt exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Thucidides.</hi> The war began in the nine months end of <hi>Aeneſias</hi> the firſt Ephorus, and ended at the pulling downe the walles of Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, 27. yeares after, which reach to the nine months end of the 28. Ephorus; ſo that from the beginning of the ſecond Ephorus, neere three months after the beginning of the warre, to the end of the 28. Ephorus, nere three months after the end of that war; are likewiſe iuſt 27. yeares, perfectly and fully compleat.</p>
               <p>And is it not euen ſo by <hi>Xenophon?</hi> doth not hee declare the throwing downe the walles in the hauen Pyraeus to haue happened toward the end of <hi>Archytas</hi> his gouernment at Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta? And are there not full and euen 27. yeares from the beginning of Braſidas, the ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus to the end of Architas, who by <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons</hi> number in that Catalogue was the 28? Is there any beetle ſo blind, which cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this exact agreement betwixt <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Thucidides,</hi> for the account of thoſe yeares?</p>
               <p>The Peloponneſian warre as may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by <hi>Thucidides,</hi> begun with the ſpring

The eleuenth Ephorus by <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophons</hi> beadroule was <hi>Pleiſtolas,</hi> for the tenth ſommer: which is verified alſo by <hi>Thucidides,</hi> in his fift booke, ſpeaking of a league made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Athenians and the Lacedemonians in the end of <hi>Pleiſtolas</hi> his Maioraltie at Sparta before the ſommer of the eleuenth yeare. The 21. Ephorus recited by <hi>Xenophon</hi> for the 20. ſommer, is <hi>Alexippidas.</hi> The trueth whereof is witneſſed and confirmed by <hi>Thucidides</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in his eight booke, wherein hee telleth that in the twentieth yere of the Peloponneſian warre a peace was concluded betweene <hi>Tiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes</hi> Lieutenant of Aſia, and the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians in the plaine of <hi>Meander, Alexippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> then being Ephorus of Sparta. The next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Alexippidas,</hi> for the 21. yeare there named, is <hi>Miſgolaidas,</hi> for the 22. <hi>Iſias,</hi> for the 23. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racus.</hi> Then after them followeth <hi>Enarchippus</hi> the fiue and twentieth Ephorus for the 24. yeres ſommer. This <hi>Enarchippus</hi> being firſt placed in the beginning of the 93. Olympiad, and after by his Catalogue found in the 24. yeare of the Peloponneſian war; leaueth this cleere by <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophons</hi> meaning, that the 24. yeare of that war
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9226:35"/>
beginning with ſommer, was the firſt of the 93. Olympiad. The three Ephori after <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchippus,</hi> ſucceeding in the other three yeares of that Olympiad ſet downe by <hi>Xenophon</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not onely in his table, but euen in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of his Hiſtorie, for three ſeuerall yeares are theſe. <hi>Pantacles, Pyteas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Archytas,</hi> in whoſe time the Athenians beeing conquered by <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> were driuen to yeeld. The next yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the firſt of a new Olimpiad, ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged moſt truely, and verie orderly by <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> himſelfe, in his ſecond booke; where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing declared the thinges done vnder <hi>Archy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi> In the yeare following (ſaith hee) was that Olympiad wherin <hi>Crocinus</hi> the Theſſalian won the race, <hi>Endius</hi> then bearing office at Sparta, and <hi>Pythodorus</hi> ruling at Athens. Now if anye aske which Olympiad this was in number; that moſt manifeſtlie appeareth by the former, namely expreſſed to haue beene the 93, ſo that it needed not againe for the next expreſly to ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was the 94. which had bin nothing els but <hi>recocta crambe,</hi> according to the prouerb, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts ſodden againe. Furthermore <hi>Xenophon</hi> not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begining of the 2. book writeth, that the nauie of the Lacedemonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Lyſander.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 25. yeres of the war were paſt and gone, which muſt needes be in the 29. yeare. Immediatlie after hee addeth that in that yere <hi>Cyrus</hi> killed two of his kinſemen, for not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9226:36"/>
holding their handes within a muffe when they met him, as was vſed to be done to kings, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of honour and loyall dutie for their greater ſecuritie, that they might bee void of all ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; feare of harme. And then followeth that the next yeare after which muſt needes bee the 27. and laſt, <hi>Archytas</hi> was Ephorus of Sparta.</p>
               <p>Thus from <hi>Xenophon</hi> wee learne, that which <hi>Beroaldus</hi> wiſhed, the 24. and 27. yeres of the Peloponneſian warre yoaked the one with the firſt, the other with the laſt of the 93. Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, which for ſound knowledge of the Perſian times, to diſcerne them a right is very material, and a ſure bulwarke for defence of my former Chronologie. Whereby was proued that <hi>Cyrus</hi> begun in the firſt of the 55. Olympiad towarde the end, from which time to the fourth of the 93 nere ended are 155. yeares. That is to ſay. 30 of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> 8 of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> 36 of his ſucceſſor, of <hi>Xerxes</hi> 21. of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> 40. &amp; with that of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and <hi>Sogdianus</hi> included 20. of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Nothus;</hi> whoſe raigne ended almoſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Peloponneſian warre, as before hath beene declared by the teſtimonie of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus,</hi> and appeareth by <hi>Thucidides</hi> making his thirteenth, the twentieth of the warre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſtoſthenes</hi> an auncient writer in the time of <hi>Ptolomeus Euergetes</hi> (a man to vſe <hi>Plinie</hi> his terme) cunning in the ſubtiltie of all learning
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9226:36"/>
and approued of all (ſo <hi>Plinie</hi> teſtifieth of him in his ſecond booke) ſet forth certaine rules of Chronologie; which <hi>Dioniſius Halicarnaſſeus</hi> for the truth thereof, &amp; exact reckoning great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commendeth in his firſt book of Roman an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities. Theſe rules haue beene preſerued vnto this age by the carefull diligence of the ancient learned father <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus.</hi> 1. <hi>Strom.</hi> From the firſt Olympiad to <hi>Xerxes</hi> paſſing into Greece, he accounted 297. yeares: thence to the beginning of the Peloponneſian warre 48. and after to the end and diſſolution of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians common wealth 27. all theſe gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together are 372. from the firſt Olympiad, ſo ſaieth <hi>Eratoſthenes,</hi> agreeing with <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons</hi> reckoning to <hi>Archytas</hi> his Maioraltie at Sparta ended with that warre and the fourth of the 93. Olympiad. For 93. Olympiads are foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore &amp; thirteene times foure yeres, that is the number of <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> 372. From which ſumme 54. Olympiads, contayning 216. before that wherein <hi>Cyrus</hi> begun, being taken awaie; with almoſt one yeare more from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> there remaineth for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Monarchie to the end of the Peloponneſian warre 155. yeares before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> was a man of wonderfull paines, and exceedingly preciſe in exact com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. He ſpent thirtie yeares in making his Hiſtorie, from Sicilie his natiue countrie hee
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9226:37"/>
trauailed into Egypt, and the greateſt part of Aſia, and Europe to ſearch the trueth of thoſe thinges which hee wrote. A diligent reader of all the auncient writers before him from <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi> and other before and after ſucceding in order, whom hee hath followed in the matters which he telleth. And therefore not vnfitly the title of his worke is called, not a Hiſtorie but a Librarie. <hi>Iuſtinus Martyr</hi> called him the moſt famous Hiſtoriographer of the Grecians. <hi>Euſebius</hi> commendeth him by the name of a notable man, in great requeſt among the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But <hi>Henry Stephen</hi> aboue all other prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him exceedingly, giuing him that place &amp; degree amongſt the learned Hiſtoriographers, which the ſunne hath amongſt the ſtarres; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of exact defining thoſe thinges which he writeth of by ordered times. This writer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confirming all thoſe thinges before ſpoken of touching the kings of Perſia, and the time of their raigne may be in ſteed of many: ſo as in him alone we may ſee the iudgement not onely of <hi>Herodotus, Thucidides, Xenophon;</hi> but alſo of <hi>Calliſthenes, Duris, Timaeus, Philiſcus, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pompus, Ephorus,</hi> and other by him diligentlie read, peruſed and cyted, which at this day are not any where found.</p>
               <p>It were infinite to bring all that might bee ſaid out of Authors for the verefying of this Chronologie: tedious to be read, &amp; toyleſome
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9226:37"/>
to be written. Therefore paſſing ouer many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of diuers writers, I will now come to the Roman Storie, to ſee if it likewiſe by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, may auaile any thing to fortifie thoſe limits and bounds, which haue beene ſet for the Perſian kings.</p>
               <p>The Romanes in continuance of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Lordes of Greece, where the Olympicke ſports were celebrated. And therefore it could not otherwiſe bee, but that they knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how the yeares of their Citie were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Olympick reckoning of the Grecians. <hi>Polybius</hi> of Megalopolis a Cittie in Arcadia, neere as auncient as <hi>Eratoſthenes,</hi> by <hi>Cicero</hi> accounted amongſt the beſt authors, for worthineſſe &amp; credit commended by <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> by <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> honoured with this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, that he was a man excelling in wit, had in great eſtimation, and followed by <hi>Liuie</hi> and other: in the third booke of his hiſtorie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that the firſt Conſuls of Rome were 28. yeares before the paſſage of <hi>Xerxes</hi> into Greece, which was in the end of the laſt yeare of the 74. Olympiad, as appeareth by that which before hath bin declared. Hereof it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the firſt of the 68. Olympiad bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 14. of <hi>Darius Hiſtaſpis,</hi> was that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the new gouernment of that Cittie by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls was eſtabliſhed. Whereas before it had bin gouerned by kings for the ſpace of 244. yeares
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9226:38"/>
from the firſt building thereof, vnto this time adding 28. yeares, or ſeauen Olympiads more. We come toward the end of the laſt yeare of the 74. Olympiad, &amp; being the 272. of Rome, wherin <hi>Xerxes</hi> paſſed into Greece, as <hi>Polybius</hi> teſtifieth; the next yeare after was the firſt of the 75. wherein <hi>Xerxes</hi> with his great armie was ouercome, as before hath bin prooued.</p>
               <p>The truth hereof is verified by <hi>A. Gellius</hi> in the laſt chapter of his ſeuenteenth book, where he writeth that <hi>Xerxes</hi> was ouercome by <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> at Salamis foure yeres before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip of <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Horatius Puluillus,</hi> wherein a great kinred of noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans called Fabij, to the number of 306. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken vpon them at their owne charge to fight againſt a certaine people, were ſlaine by the ſubtiltie of their enemies, circumuented at the riuer Cremera: for this is declared by the Romane hiſtories, to haue fallen out in the 277 yeare of Rome, and the 33. from the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of Halicarnaſſus in his fift booke of Romane antiquities, reckoneth ſixteene yeares betwixt <hi>Brutus</hi> one of the firſt Conſuls death in the end of his yeare, and the Marathon fight, referring the battaile at Marathon to the ſeuenteenth yeare after <hi>Brutus</hi> his buriall, and the eighteenth after the kings driuen out of the Citie, wherein <hi>Gegainus, Macerinus,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9226:38"/>
Augurinus</hi> were Conſuls.<note place="margin">In his 7. Booke.</note> Which by conſtant agreement of almoſt all authors, hee ſayeth was in the ſecond yeare of the 72. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad. So he maketh the 31. of <hi>Darius Hiſtaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis,</hi> and the 262. of Rome, and the ſecond of the 72. Olimp. all one yeare: as it was indeede moſt exactly agreeing to the teſtimony of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius</hi> before rehearſed, and the Greeke Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie of the Perſian kings and the Olympick reckoning. <hi>A. Gellius</hi> in the place aforenamed ſaith, that the Marathon battell happened in the 260. yeare of Rome: which is likewiſe true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his beginning of the yeares of that City, as afterward ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liuie</hi> the famous Latine writer of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane hiſtorie, in the end of his fift booke tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that the Frenchmen and Swichers hauing inuaded a certaine people of Italie, were by a noble ambaſſage from Rome intreated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, without hurting their friends and aſſociats hauing no cauſe offered to doe it. This verie ſtoutly they refuſed to doe, except they might haue part of that countrie graunted vnto them to dwell in: a thing thought vnreaſonable, that by force of armes &amp; dint of ſword they ſhould go about to take that which pertained nothing vnto them. Whereuppon they fell to a fierce and ſharpe battaile, wherein the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors contrarie to the law of armes, tooke part with their aſſociate neighbours againſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9226:39"/>
them: yea killed one of their chiefe captaines. At the firſt the French by their legates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, &amp; receiuing no amendes for the wrong done vnto them; their heartes were ſo ſtirred, that preſently without any more adoe they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their force againſt Rome, going in all haſte to inuade it. About eleuen mile from the Citie, they were met withall by the Romans, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to flight, fled the greateſt part to other places, a few to Rome; which was ſo interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Citizens, as though all the reſt had beene ſlaine; being aſtoniſhed with feare, they had no regard to ſhut their gates. At the length they ſent a certaine number of the ſtouteſt and ſtrongeſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into their Caſtle called the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll, well appointed with victuals and weapons to defend it. The aged Senators being reſolued to hazard their liues, &amp; to bequeath themſelues to the ſword, went home, ſate downe in theyr robes at the entrie of their houſes in open ſight of their enemies, who meruailed thereat: yet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing no crueltie, till one of them for ſtroaking <hi>M. Papirius</hi> an old Senator, his beard was rapt on the pate for his labour with an iuorie ſtaffe. Then began the ſlaughter, firſt of him, after of the reſt; the Citie they ſacked and burned, all but the Capitoll, which had bin taken alſo by them in the night climing vp, had not the kea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Geeſe in time bewrayed their intent. This calamitie happened to the Romans in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9226:39"/>
the 365. yeare of Rome, as we reade in <hi>Liuie:</hi> which by auncient regiſters and recordes of the Cenſors, of long time preſerued in their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, from father to childe by many ages, was teſtified to be the 121. yeare from the laſt kings raigne. Theſe records <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaus</hi> read and ſaw with his eyes. This 121. after the Conſuls, with 244. before them, make vp <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies</hi> number 365.</p>
               <p>Now that Rome was taken of the Swichers in the beginning of the 98. Olympiad, is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by great agreement of learned writers in the firſt booke of the ſame <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> which from the 68. wherein the Conſuls began, is iuſt the 121. yeare. Adding hereunto the yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 68. Olympiad, to the beginning of the Perſian Monarchie in the 55. and thoſe after the 98. Olympiad, to the ende thereof in the third of the 112. all agree. The Olympick rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of the Perſian times is iuſtified by the Romaine Hiſtorie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polybius</hi> in his third book telleth, that <hi>L. Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mylius</hi> being Conſul of Rome, was ſent into Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrium with an armie in the firſt yeare of the 140. Olympiad. At what time <hi>Annibal</hi> ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Spayne to beſiege Sagunt, which by the Roman hiſtorie is found the 533. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie. Of theſe 533. one hundred and eleuen were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the death of the laſt king of Perſia and that ſetting forth of <hi>L. Aemylius.</hi> And 192. of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9226:40"/>
them were from the beginning of Rome, with the ſeuenth Olympiad to <hi>Cyrus.</hi> There remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for the Perſian Empire 230. yeares, which ſpace for it before hath been declared, and now once againe prooued by the yeares of Rome.</p>
               <p>One proofe more of the teſtimonie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ſo an end: Time is of the Philoſophers defined to be the meaſure of the heauenly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the courſe and mouing whereof being alwaies certaine &amp; vniforme, without diſorder or going aſtray, how ſo euer it is with men, there can be no error in it. By that meaſure is knowne the length from one <hi>Solstitium</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, from eclips to eclips, exactlie without miſſing a daye or an houre. Aſtronomie, ſaith <hi>Temporarius,</hi> teacheth what ſpace of Heauen, the Sunne, the Moone, and other Starres, runne out in an houre, a daye, a moneth, a yeare, yea many thouſand yeares, and defineth the ſpaces from one eclips to another moſt perfectlie; ſo as one of them being once found, we cannot after for the times following be deceaued in a daye. <hi>Ptolomie</hi> a learned Aegyptian, of a deepe and long reach in the knowledge of Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and other Mathematicall ſciences, in his Almageſt hath recorded diuers eclipſes of the Moone of ancient time preſerued amongſt them, from the beginning of <hi>Nabonaſars</hi> raigne, long before the Iewes captiuitie in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon: which <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> in his booke, <hi>de die
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9226:40"/>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t à nostris ita ab Aegyptijs, quidam aenni in literas relati ſunt, quos Nabonozaru nominant; quod à primo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius imperij anno conſurgant</hi> As (ſaith he) of our men, ſo of the Aegyptians, certaine yeares haue been committed to writing, which they call <hi>Nabonaſars,</hi> becauſe they riſe together with the beginning of this Empire. One of theſe eclipſes there by him ſo regiſtred, happened in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth yeare of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> about the 16. daye of Iulie, 224. yeares, and 140. dayes after the beginning of <hi>Nabonaſar,</hi> which was the ſixe and twentie daye of Februarie, in the firſt yeare of the eyght Olympiad, and the fift yeare of Rome. Another by the ſame <hi>Ptolomie</hi> recorded, was in the yeare wherein <hi>Phanostratus</hi> was Maior of Athens, 365. yeares, with 112. dayes after <hi>Nabonaſars</hi> coronation, which leade vs to the eyghteenth daye of Iune, in that yeare of <hi>Phanostratus</hi> now very neere ſpent. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of theſe ecclipſes, by examination is found full a hundred one and fortie yeares with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one moneth. So much time by the courſe of Heauen ran out, from the ſixeteenth daye of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, in the ſeuenth of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> being the ſecond yeare of the 64. Olympiad; to the eyght daye of Iune, in the yeare of <hi>Phanostratus,</hi> which <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> very truely ſetteth in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the 99. Olympiad, yet blamed for it by <hi>Temporarius</hi> in his third booke of Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9226:41"/>
demonſtrations: who ſtriueth for that yeare of <hi>Phanostratus</hi> to be the third of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Olympiad but all in vaine. Heauen it ſelfe giueth ſentence againſt him, and verifieth the teſtimonie of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> making the very ſame number neither more nor leſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meto,</hi> a skilfull and learned Aſtronomer, as <hi>Ptolomie</hi> in the third booke of his Almageſt declareth in the 316. yeare of <hi>Nabonaſar,</hi> the 21. daye of the Aegyptian moneth Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menoth, anſwerable by our computation to the 28. day of Iune, <hi>Apſendes</hi> then ruling at Athens, obſerued the Aſtronomicall poynte of ſummers beginning, called <hi>Solstitium,</hi> which in this our age is about the eleuenth of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the Sunne then entring into the tropicke of <hi>Cancer.</hi> So great alteration in the ſpace of 2020. yeares is bred betwixt our time and theirs, for want of exact appoynting and right ordering of the leape yeare. From that time to the end of the 50. yeare of <hi>Calippus</hi> his firſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod: <hi>Hipparchus</hi> an excellent Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, a man whome nature made partaker of her ſecrets, as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth of him; gathered a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſumme of 152. yeares. That this period of <hi>Calippus</hi> began with the third yeare of the 112. Olympiad, it is agreed by cleere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of many writers. For about that time <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was ſlaine, and thereby this period of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi> began together with <hi>Alexanders</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9226:41"/>
now by the death of <hi>Darius</hi> eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in his hands, without clayme of any. In memorie whereof this period was ordayned, and the account of yeares after taken from that head.</p>
               <p>The 50. yeares then of this period being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the former ſumme, there remaynes 102. yeares from the end of <hi>Apſendes</hi> his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, to the death of the laſt king of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia: which by the recorde of auncient writers is ſo acknowledged and verified, placing <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendes</hi> in the laſt of the 86. Olympiad (which was the 32. yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the long han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) and the ſlaughter of <hi>Darius</hi> in the third of the 112. Theſe 102. with 127. and ſome odde moneths from <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the 32. of that <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> included, containe the receaued time of the Perſian kings, 229. yeares with ſome few moneths more to the beginning of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Monarchie, at the laſt Perſian kings death. Which euen that moſt famous eclipſe of the very next yeare before, wherewith <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſouldiers were ſcared, eleuen dayes before his laſt battaile againſt <hi>Darius;</hi> putteth out of doubt. For from that in the ſeuenth of <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> before ſpoken of, to this Aſtronomical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by exact calculation, findeth 192. yeares and 66. dayes. Which with the time following from the laſt eclipſe to <hi>Darius</hi> his death, and the yeares of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> before the

                  <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger</hi> a man of rare giftes, a great light of this age; one whome the Churche of GOD for his paines, is much beholding to, in his fift booke <hi>de emendatione temporum,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Xerxes</hi> his paſſage into Greece, is ſo vncertaine and wauering in this poynt, that it is hard to finde in what iudgement he reſted. For firſt hee maketh it a thing vndoubted, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> paſſed into Europe in the ende of the fourth yeare of the 47. Olympiad: and in the beginning of the 75. fought at Thermopylae: then a little after hee thinketh that paſſage of <hi>Xerxes</hi> to haue happened the yeare before, that is to ſaye, in the end of the third yeare of the 47. Olympiad, being moued thereunto by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Thucidides.</hi> The one euen <hi>Herodotus</hi> in Polymnia, making mention of an eclipſe of the Sunne, at ſuch time as <hi>Xerx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> marched forward with his hoaſt from Sardes toward Europe in the ſpring time of the yeare: which by <hi>Scaligers</hi> calculation fell to the third yeare of the 74. Olympiad, and ſo <hi>Xerxes</hi> his battailes in Greece to the fourth yeare of it. The other, that is <hi>Thucidides</hi> in his firſt booke, writing that the Perſians once againe inuaded Greece in the tenth yeare after the Marothon field, which being fought in the ſecond yeare of the 72. Olympiad, the tenth after it, is the fourth of the 74. Againe, contrarie to both theſe ſentences, he yet alleageth another from

                  <hi>Eratosthenes, Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> three worthy men for skil, who referred <hi>Xerxes</hi> his paſſage into Greece to the firſt yeare of the 75.

               <p>Firſt therefore concerning <hi>Herodotus,</hi> it is euident and playne by his teſtimonie, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> fought his battailes in Greece, in the firſt yeare of the 75. Olympiad; becauſe he maketh account of 80. yeares from the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> thether: and if this bee not enough, the ſame Author in playne wordes declareth, that the games of Olympia were celebrated about that very time, wherein <hi>Leonides</hi> reſiſted his huge hoaſt, and ſtopped their paſſage. Firſt in Polym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſpeaking of this matter, he ſayeth, that the time of the Olympiad fell out together with that buſines. Againe in Vrania he confirmeth it, telling that as <hi>Xerxes</hi> marched forward from Thermopylae, certaine Grecians came vnto him offering their ſeruice, who being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what the Grecians then were about, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that they kept and beheld the Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an games, the winners whereof receiued an Oliue crowne: which one <hi>Tigranes</hi> a noble

Lord of Perſia hearing, preſently burſt forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſpeech: What worthie men are wee brought to fight againſt; which ſtriue not for money, but vertue and proweſſe. This then by <hi>Herodotus</hi> his owne mouth being thus made cleere, that the yeare of <hi>Xerxes</hi> fighting in Greece, was an Olympicke yeare, it could not poſſibly be in <hi>Herodotus</hi> iudgement, as <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> would haue it, the fourth yeare of the 74. Olympiad. Moreouer, <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth in V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania, that <hi>Callias</hi> was then Maior of Athens, when <hi>Xerxes</hi> tooke that Citie and burned it, which yeare of <hi>Callias</hi> his Maioraltie at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, being the firſt of the 75.

               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:9226:44"/>Now to come to <hi>Thucidides,</hi> whereas hee writeth that the tenth yeare after the Perſians ouerthrow at Marathon, they came againe with a huge armie to ſubdue Greece; he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that yeare to be the tenth, wherein <hi>Xerxes</hi> hauing gathered his armie together, marched to Sardes: which was the very beginning of that warre, for that was the firſt leading of his armie againſt the Grecians: and in that yeare he made a bridge from Aſia to Europe, for the paſſage of his armie ouer, and digged downe the hill Atho, to make the ſeas meete for his Ships to paſſe through, and ſent his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors into Greece, to demaunde land and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which was a kinde of proclayming warre againſt ſuch as refuſed to be ſubiect vnto him. Theſe things all were done in the tenth yeare after the Marathon fight: and in the next which was the firſt of the 75. Olympiad, were <hi>Xerxes</hi> his battailes fought at Thermopylae, and other places of Greece, being the eleuenth from that Marathon warre, euen ſo acknowledged by <hi>Scaliger</hi> himſelfe in that booke, in the chapter of the Perſians ouerthrowe at Marathon; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer after he ſeemeth to be of another opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to make it the tenth, not vnderſtanding <hi>Thucidides</hi> aright.</p>
               <p>Yea but <hi>Eratosthenes, Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> three excellent writers, referred the paſſage of <hi>Xerxes</hi> into Greece, to the firſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9226:44"/>
yeare of the 75. Olympiad, and ſo his battaile at Thermopylae, to the ſecond yeare thereof. <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosthenes</hi> indeede I graunt, reckoning from the firſt Olympiad to <hi>Xerxes</hi> paſſing into Greece 297. yeares, reacheth to the beginning of the ſecond yeare of the 75. Olympiad, and goeth a yeare further then other. Yet ſo as if any thing be here amiſſe, it is mended in his next account, from <hi>Xerxes</hi> to the Peloponneſian warre, the diſtance whereof he maketh 48. yeares; which with the former 297. are in all 345. from the firſt Olympiad, to the firſt ſummer of the Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſian warre: which is a moſt perfect rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning receiued and agreed on, ſo there is no great matter of difference.</p>
               <p>Now touching <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> his words are ſo manifeſt againſt that aſſertion of <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> as maketh me meruaile that he ſhould be ſo deceiued in miſtaking them. Firſt the worde which he vſeth is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, he warred, or led his armie, being much more large then he paſſed ouer. Againe hauing deſcribed the yeare by the number of the Olympiad 75. the firſt yeare thereof, and the chiefe officer of Athens <hi>Callias,</hi> and the Romane Conſuls: he ſetteth downe for that yeare ſo deſcribed, the battailes of <hi>Xerxes</hi> at Thermopylae, at Artemyſium, at Salamis, and his flying out of Greece, and the leauing of <hi>Mardonius</hi> there with a great hoaſt. And in the ſecond yeare of that Olympiad, being the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9226:45"/>
yeare of <hi>Xantippus</hi> his Maioraltie at Athens; he placeth the victory of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> againſt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> at Plateae, and the departure of <hi>Xerxes</hi> from Sardes to Suſa, after the ouerthrow of his forces by ſea and by land: ſo that there is no doubt at all by <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> but that <hi>Xerxes</hi> his fighting at <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> happened in the firſt yere of the 75. Olympiad, according to the teſtimonies and conſent of auncient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers before declared.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Plutarch,</hi> howſoeuer that is gathered of his wordes in one place there cited by <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> yet otherwhere he ſheweth himſelfe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other minde: For in the life of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> the battell at Plateae which happened the very next yeare after <hi>Xerxes</hi> his diſcomfiture, hee refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to the ſecond of that Olymp. that by the iudgement of <hi>Scaliger</hi> himſelfe ſo expounding the place, in his firſt booke treating of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban period. If then the next yeare after <hi>Xerxes</hi> inuading Greece be the ſecond of the 75. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad by <hi>Plutarch;</hi> needes muſt the yeare of <hi>Xerxes</hi> fighting in Greece, by him bee the firſt, which is agreeable to others Chronologie and the verie trueth.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Numa</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſome doubt of the Olympick reckoning, beeing committed to writing in regard of the beginning thereof verie late, by <hi>Hyppias</hi> of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, without any ſure ground, whereunto of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9226:45"/>
we muſt yeeld credit. This obiection is anſwered by <hi>Temporarius</hi> in his Chronologie, that though it were graunted that <hi>Hyppias</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſetting downe the true and exact time of the firſt Olympiad, yet that hindereth the true Chronologie and order of times following no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, which is very true: for ſet the caſe, that that Olympiad which <hi>Hyppias</hi> made the 40. in number, was not ſo much, but onely the 30. and ſo the firſt, 40. yeares ſhort at the leaſt of his account. It is not a pin matter. The order and account of the times comming after for all that, may be moſt perfect and ſure without miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one minute, which I wil declare by a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar example. The yeare wherein our gracious Queene began her happie raigne, according to the computation of the Church of England, was the 1558. of our Lorde, but in truth the 1558. &amp; this yere by our account 1597. is in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indeed by exact reckoning 1598. The cauſe wherof was the errour of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> called <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus Abbas,</hi> who was the firſt inuenter of this account, ſuppoſing Chriſts birth to haue beene later by one yeare then indeede it was: and ſo making that the firſt of our Lorde, which was the ſecond; as is confeſſed and acknowledged of the beſt learned and moſt skilfull Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers of our age. This error in the firſt yeare of Chriſt, is no let at all to the exact reckoning of all the yeres following. For there is the ſame
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9226:46"/>
diſtance of yeares, from the 1558. to the 1597. by the vſuall account: which is from the 1559, to the 1598. by the true account. Yet to ſpeake my minde, howſoeuer <hi>Dionyſius</hi> miſſed in the reckoning of the yeares of Chriſt; I hold it out of controuerſie that <hi>Hippias</hi> erred not, vnto whoſe time the memory of the Olympiads had beene preſerued, from foure yeares to foure yeares, from the beginning thereof, in times of knowledge, &amp; places of fame, where was great concourſe of people keeping the account ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not in their mindes onely, but alſo in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges as is moſt like. And whether hee erred or no; for the Perſian times and after it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I haue declared before, ſeeing the error in the firſt is conſtant in all the reſt, if any error haue beene.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Plutarchs</hi> doubt for any thing that I can ſee, had no reaſon at all, but ſeemeth to ſauour of an vſuall cuſtome of the Academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſect, which was alwaies readie furniſhed to diſpute on eyther ſide, <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>contra,</hi> eyther for the truth or againſt it. For this is moſt certaine that hee followeth that reckoning by Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads himſelfe in many places, as giuing credit thereunto and making no doubt thereof. In his treatiſe of the ten Orators he ſaith, that <hi>Andoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> was borne in the 78. Olympiad, when <hi>Theogenides</hi> was gouernour of Athens. And that <hi>Callias</hi> was gouernour in the 92. Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9226:46"/>
and that <hi>Iſocrates</hi> was borne vnder <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> in the 86. Olymp. 22. yeares after <hi>Lyſias,</hi> whoſe birth he ſetteth in the ſecond of the 80. Olympiad, in the yeare of <hi>Philocles:</hi> all which reckonings agree very perfectly to the ancient Olympick account, and the Hiſtories of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides, Xenophon,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus. Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> in the fourth Chapter of his 36. booke hath theſe wordes; <hi>Marmore ſcalpendo primi om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium inclaruerunt Dipoenus &amp; Scyllis, geniti in Creta inſula etiamnum Medis imperitanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus: Priuſquam Cyrus in Perſis regnare incipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, hoc eſt Olympiade circiter quinquageſima.</hi> The firſt of all other for grauing of marble were famous <hi>Dipoenus</hi> &amp; <hi>Scyllis,</hi> born in the Iland of Creta, whilſt yet the Medes bare rule; before <hi>Cyrus</hi> began to raigne in Perſia, that is about the 50. Olympiad. Hereof <hi>Matthew Beroald</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of his booke of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie gathereth, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> began in the 50. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad by <hi>Plinies</hi> teſtimonie, herein diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from other, who placed his beginning in the 55 but whoſoeuer commeth with an euen minde to the truth, may eaſilie perceiue another meaning in <hi>Plinie,</hi> &amp; that the words <hi>hoc eſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiade circiter</hi> 50, ought not to be referred to that which is ſaid of <hi>Cyrus, priuſquam reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare inciperet,</hi> before he began to raigne; but the former part of the ſentence giuing vs this to vnderſtand the time wherin <hi>Dipoenus</hi> &amp; <hi>Scyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:9226:47"/>
were famous engrauers in Marble, to haue beene about the 50. Olympiad in the dayes of the Medes Soueraigntie before <hi>Cyrus</hi> had got it away from them to the Perſians. Thus no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention at all betweene <hi>Plinie</hi> and other, but great agreement is found.</p>
               <p>Much other ſuch like ſtuffe is brought of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaldus</hi> from diuers authors, by cold coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, not any ſure knowledge: all for the moſt part in that kind as maketh either againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or nothing for him. <hi>Pericles</hi> being a yong man, was of ſome of the aged ſort in Athens thought to fauor <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> the tirant in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinance &amp; ſpeech, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> telleth in his life, which could not bee as <hi>Beroaldus</hi> ſuppoſed, except the old men who had knowne <hi>Piſiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> had at that time beene a hundred yeres old. A thing in his iudgement vnlike to bee true. It is not ſo vnlike, as ſtrange that a man of his learning and reading ſhould iudge ſo of it; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we read of many examples of men of thoſe yeares. <hi>Valerius Corninus,</hi> who was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull of Rome ſix times, liued full out a hundred yeares, and likewiſe <hi>Metellus Pontifex. Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in his Polihiſtor telleth, that <hi>Maſiniſſa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his Sonne <hi>Methymnus</hi> at 86. yeres age. In the time of <hi>Claudius Caeſar,</hi> one <hi>T. Fullonius</hi> of Bononia, was found to be 150. yeres of age, which in Lydia was a common thing, as by <hi>Mutianus</hi> is reported. <hi>Terentia</hi> the wife of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:9226:47"/>
liued 107. <hi>Clodia</hi> 115. Many other by <hi>Plinie</hi> are recorded in his ſeuenth booke the 48 49, 50, Chapters, in diuers countries betweene a hundred, and a hundred and 50. yeares olde. But of all other one <hi>Xenophilus</hi> liuing 105. yeares without anie diſeaſe or hurt of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, was wondred at. That <hi>Gorgias Leonti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a famous Oratour much about that time with <hi>Pericles,</hi> liued 109. yeares, wee haue the teſtimonie of <hi>Appolodorus</hi> his Chronicles in <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> within one yere acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged alſo by <hi>Plinie.</hi> Euen in this our age at home in our own countrie, it is no ſtrange thing to find examples of ſuch as liued out that time, which <hi>Beroaldus</hi> accounted ſo incredible, that he could not perſwade himſelfe of it to be true: but his incredulitie is no proofe to weaken the credit of credible writers. But I will not ſtrike with him for this to graunt it a thing vncredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let vs examine his reckoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pericles</hi> died in the third yeare of the 87. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limpiad (not the 88. as <hi>Beroaldus</hi> ſaith) before his death he had beene one of the chiefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Athenian common wealth fortie yeares. This <hi>Cicero</hi> teacheth in his third booke <hi>de oratore:</hi> ſo the beginning of his authoritie falleth to the three yeares (not of the 78. as <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaldus</hi> would) but the 77. Olympiad. About that time ſome olde men gaue this iudgement of him, that he was like <hi>Piſiſtratus:</hi> and might
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9226:48"/>
not that be done but of ſuch as were then a 100 yeres old? ſurely yes; for <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> died not paſt threeſcore yeares before: whereof 22. had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Marathon battaile, and 20. more from the expelling of <hi>Hippias</hi> out of Athens, declared by <hi>Thucidides,</hi> and 18. before from the beginning of <hi>Hippias</hi> who ſucceded <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus.</hi> Yet ſome more beſides theſe muſt bee added to the old mens age to haue knowledge of <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> in his life time to deale liberally, let that time be twentie yeres before the death of <hi>Piſiſtratus:</hi> ſo their age is left foure ſcore yeres very vſuall at this day in diuers luſty men, although I would haue this obſerued which <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth, that iudgement to haue bin giuen of <hi>Pericles</hi> when hee was a young man, whereby ſome aduantage yet might farther be taken if it were a matter worth the ſtanding vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Aelianus</hi> in his third book, the 21. chapter (ſaith <hi>Beroaldus</hi>) telleth of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> that being a childe, and as hee came from Schoole meeting <hi>Piſistratus</hi> the tyrant, was willed by his ouerſeer attending vpon him to goe out of the way: which he refuſed to doe, and asked if there were not roome enough for him beſides. Whereunto is repugnant that which <hi>Iustin</hi> telleth in his ſecond booke, that <hi>Themistocles</hi> was a young man at the Marathon war, when he muſt needes be at the leaſt 66. yeares olde, if <hi>Aelianus</hi> ſay true: for the ſonnes of <hi>Piſistratus</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:9226:48"/>
after their fathers death raigned 36. yeares, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his fift booke, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were twentie more to the Marathon fight; and before <hi>Themistocles</hi> could in ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſhew ſo ſtoute a minde againſt the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, it is like he was ten yeares of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beroaldus</hi> here alſo in his account is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, miſtaking <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who in Terpſichore indeede affirmeth, that the Piſiſtratan ſtocke raigned 36. yeares: yet not meaning thereby as <hi>Beroaldus</hi> would faine haue it, that <hi>Piſistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his children raigned ſo long after their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death; but that the whole time of father and ſonne was in all ſo much. This appeareth by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> an author for credit very ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, in the fift booke of his politickes the twelft chapter, making the whole raigne of the Piſiſtratan ſtocke 35. yeares, that is 17. of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistratus</hi> himſelfe, and 18. after of his children. And ſo is <hi>Herodotus</hi> to be vnderſtoode, giuing them 36. in all, onely differing from <hi>Aristotle</hi> in a yeare. Whereby it may be thought that <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistratus</hi> raigned ſome few moneths more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 17. yeares: ſo his reckoning comes ſhort by almoſt twentie yeares.

of him in his ſixt booke. And this in my iudgement is the man, to whome that Hiſtorie in <hi>Aelianus</hi> may be fitly applied, and ſtand ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well with that which <hi>Iustin</hi> hath concerning <hi>Themistocles</hi> fighting at Marathon.</p>
               <p>Yea but <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 34. booke writeth, that the Athenians the ſame yeare wherein the kings of Rome were driuen out, being the fourth of the 67. Olympiad, ſet vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> images of <hi>Harmodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Aristogiton,</hi> who had killed <hi>Hipparchus</hi> the tyrant: farre wide from that which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> telleth in his ſixt booke, that <hi>Hipparchus</hi> was ruler at Athens in the 71. Olympiad. What ſay you to that? Nothing, but that <hi>Beroaldus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belike aſhamed of his follie in bringing ſuch an argument, calleth it in againe as it were, by anſwering that it was another <hi>Hipparchus</hi> which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſpeaketh of. Another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he taketh from <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in his fift booke, making the warre at Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon later by ſixteene yeares then the death of <hi>Brutus;</hi> thereby referring the yeare to the fourth of the 71. Olympiad, which by <hi>Cicero</hi> ſeemeth caſt to the 73. wherein <hi>Coriolanus</hi> a Senator of Rome made warre againſt it. Here we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vntrueth vpon vntrueth, fit groundes for ſuch a rotten building: for ſixteene yeares after that of the firſt Conſuls, which was by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi> the firſt of the 68. Olympiad, in the end whereof <hi>Brutus</hi> was ſlaine, reach not to the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:9226:49"/>
fourth of the 71. but to the ſecond of the 72. Olympiad: wherein the ſame <hi>Dionyſius</hi> in plaine words placeth that warre. As for that of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> againſt Rome, it happened in deed in the firſt of the 73. Olympiad, onely three yeares after the other. And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Brutus affirming, not that this of <hi>Coriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was at the ſame time, with that other of the Perſians, but almoſt at that time, ſpeaketh a trueth, diſſenting nothing at all from <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It followeth in <hi>Beroaldus:</hi> the ſame <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> in his ninth booke, <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him ſaith, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> went to warre againſt Greece in the 75. Olympiad, when <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> gouerned Athens: that is twelue yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Marathon fight being paſt, to that of <hi>Xerxes</hi> at Salamis: <hi>Gloſſa corrumpit textum,</hi> the gloſſe here marreth the text with a manifeſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth: for neither <hi>Dionyſius</hi> nor <hi>Diodorus</hi> maketh aboue eleauen yeares diſtance betwixt thoſe battailes, the one placed in the ſecond of the 72. Olympiad, the other in the firſt of the 75, almoſt in the beginning thereof. Now let any man count the diſtance betweene, on his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends, and ſee if he can finde twelue yeares. But to omit this and come to the purpoſe: <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> was at the time of <hi>Xerxes</hi> his warre by <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> tyrant of Syracuſae. And <hi>Gelo</hi> tyrant of Syracuſae, by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9226:50"/>
of <hi>Lyſias</hi> the Orator, in the ſecond of the 82. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad. So the war of <hi>Xerxes</hi> muſt by this rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning come backe neere 30. yeares after the 75. Olympick ſport. <hi>Plutarchs</hi> words are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. That is in Engliſh thus much, <hi>Lyſias</hi> an exceeding rich man, was the ſonne of <hi>Cephales,</hi> grand childe of <hi>Lyſanias,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Cephales:</hi> his father <hi>Cephales</hi> was a Syracuſian borne, and flitted to Athens for loue, partly of the citie, and partly of <hi>Pericles</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Xanthippus,</hi> who perſwaded him thereto being his friend and hoſt: or as ſome ſay, for that hee was driuen from Syracuſae, at ſuch time as it was ſubiect to the tyrannie of <hi>Gelo.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that Lyſias was borne.</note> Being borne at Athens vnder <hi>Philocles,</hi> the next ruler after <hi>Phraſicles,</hi> hee was firſt brought vp with the nobleſt children of the Athenians, about the ſecond yeare of the 83.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:9226:50"/>
olde in the ſecond yeare of the 82.

Olympiad, as we reade in the ſame <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and the fifteenth of <hi>Lyſias</hi> his birth. Where can <hi>Beroaldus</hi> now finde in this place of Plutarch, that <hi>Gelo</hi> was tyrant of Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſae, in the ſecond yeare of the 82. Olympiad? What meant he ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently to burſt forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint? <hi>Tam incerta ſunt apud aut ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res rerum istarum tempora:</hi> So vncertaine are the times of theſe matters: what reaſon had hee for it? For hee that vnderſtandeth Greeke, and compareth <hi>Plutarchs</hi> owne words, with that which <hi>Beroaldus</hi> gathereth by them, will bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed (I beleeue) of ſuch an interpreter, being ſo blinded with conceited affection that hee ſeeth not what is written, and careth not what he ſaith. <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth notablie in this place confirme the receiued ancient Chronologie of the Greekes: ſo farre he is by any diſagreement from weakening their credite.</p>
               <p>Let vs now examine one or two other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Beroaldus</hi> concerning the time of <hi>Xerxes</hi> fighting in Greece. In the eyght chapter of his third booke, <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> ſayth <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> telleth in his Arcadikes, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> then paſſed into Greece when <hi>Gelo</hi> gouerned at Syracuſe, which is likewiſe witneſſed by <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9226:51"/>
booke. But that ſame <hi>Pauſanias</hi> in his Eliaca affirmeth, that <hi>Gelo</hi> held the gouernment of that citie in the ſecond yeare of the 72. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad. Except it be a ſtrange thing that one king ſhould continew his raigne by the ſpace of twelue yeares. This argument of <hi>Beroaldus</hi> is not worth a ruſh to proue diſagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ancient writers, referring <hi>Gelo</hi> his tira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſome to the ſecond of the 72. Olympiad, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the firſt of the 75. when <hi>Xerxes</hi> paſſed into Europe, for the beginning of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was about the ſecond of the 72. Olympiad, as <hi>Dioniſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> declareth in the ſeauenth booke of his Roman Antiquities. And the end thereof in the 75.

                  <hi>Beroaldus</hi> hath yet more matter from <hi>Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> in his Eliaca, who referreth the ouerthrow of <hi>Mardonius</hi> at Plateae, the next yeare after <hi>Xerxes</hi> inuaded Greece, to the 75. Olympiad: whereas <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> in that Olympiad inuaded Greece, both can not bee true. The worde Olympias pertaineth ſometime to the game itſelfe celebrated euerie firſt yeare of the foure, as where <hi>Solinus</hi> telleth that the 207. Olympias was in the publike acts recorded to be in the 801. yeare of Rome, wherein <hi>Pompeius Gallus</hi> &amp; <hi>Q. Veranius</hi> were
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9226:51"/>
Conſuls, and <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> in <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> accounteth from the firſt Olympiad to the paſſage of <hi>Xerxes</hi> into Greece 297. yeares. <hi>Xenophon</hi> alſo in his Hiſtorie of the Greeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires writeth, that the next yeare after <hi>Dionyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> had got the kingdome of Syracuſae, happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that Olympias wherein <hi>Pythodorus</hi> was Maior at Athens. In all theſe places Olympias is taken for one yeare onely, and that the firſt of the foure: in which ſence <hi>Diodorus</hi> vſed it, where hee ſaith that <hi>Xerxes</hi> inuaded Greece in the 75. Olympiad. Now, becauſe that from one Olympias to another were foure yeares com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete; the word is alſo vſuallie taken for that whole ſpace of foure yeares, betwixt one and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, not much vnlike that which we read in bleſſed Lukes goſpell of the proude Phariſie, boaſting of his faſting twice in a ſabboth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one day of the weeke for all the weeke, from the beginning to the end. So it is vſed of <hi>Solinus,</hi> writing that Rome was builded in the firſt yeare of the ſeauenth Olympiad, and when the ſeauenth Olympiad began, and <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in the laſt chapter of his fourteenth booke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, ſaith that <hi>Herode</hi> tooke Ieruſalem in the 185. Olympiad, hee meaneth the whole foure yeares ſpace of that Olympiad, for that was done in the laſt yeare thereof. In this ſence that ſaying of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> is true concerning <hi>Mardonius</hi> his ouerthrow at Plateae in the 75
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:9226:52"/>
Olympiad, and ſo no diſcord proued.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Polybius,</hi> from whom hee gathereth the warre of <hi>Xerxes</hi> to haue been in the third yeare of the 74. Olympiad; there is no ſuch matter. <hi>Beroaldus</hi> was deceiued in his recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I haue brought the place of <hi>Polybius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and declared his meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oebotas,</hi> a man of Achaea wonne the race in the ſixt Olympiad, who for ſo glorious a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie receiuing not that honour of his countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which he looked for at their hands, and in his owne iudgement had deſerued; conceaued ſuch diſcontentment thereat, that hee euen cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, praying that neuer any of the Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans more might win any Olympicke game a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: which ſo fell out for a long time, till at the length by the councell of <hi>Apollo</hi> his Oracle, they had in honour of <hi>Oebotas</hi> erected a piller for an eternall monument of his vertue, with an inſcription teſtifying the ſame; which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto him in the 80. Olympiad, as <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi> telleth in his Achaica and Eliaca: who for that cauſe meruaileth at the report of ſome Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who ſaide that <hi>Oebotas</hi> fought againſt <hi>Mardonius</hi> in the 75. Olympiad, and thinketh it vncredible, as hee might well enough, that a man hauing wonne the race in the ſixt Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, ſhould bee a fighting Souldier neere two hundred and foureſcore yeares after. What is here now in <hi>Pauſanias</hi> to be ſeene, which in his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:9226:52"/>
owne perſwaſion doth not confirme the trueth of the Olympicke Chronologie, rather then make againſt it any way? For the great credite which he put therein, nothing doubting of the true reckoning of ſo many yeares betweene, bred that meruailing in him, and made him think that <hi>Oebotas</hi> which fought againſt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> in the 75. Olympiad, to haue been ſome other of that name, rather then the ancient race winner in the ſixt Olympiad. It was true, that by ſome they were ſuppoſed one and the ſame, but by ſuch as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> iudged fooles for their labour. Their folly ſtirred him neuer a whit from the true receiued account of Olympicke yeares. Of the certaintie whereof, what a ſetled and grounded perſwaſion he had may appeare by this, that in diuers places he maketh mention of Olympicke recordes and regiſters which himſelfe ſaw and read, wherein he teſtifieth the memorie of the Olympiads to haue been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by the Eleans, in whoſe countrie thoſe games were kept, and that with ſuch care and diligence, that from the firſt in <hi>Iphitus</hi> his time, to the Emperor <hi>Nero,</hi> not one of them all was miſſing: this hee witneſſeth in his Phocica, much auayling to the credite of that account.</p>
               <p>Another obiection in <hi>Beroaldus</hi> is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the time of the Peloponneſian warre, of which ſaith he, both beginning and end is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, by the diſſention of authors betweene
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9226:53"/>
themſelues. <hi>Plinie</hi> referreth the time of it to the fourth of the 81. Olympiad, and <hi>A. Gellius</hi> to the firſt of the 89. and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> to the third of the 87. So ſaith <hi>Beroaldus.</hi> If truelie, there is great ods between them. <hi>Plinies</hi> words in the thirtie booke and firſt chapter are theſe: <hi>Plenumque miraculi &amp; hoc, pariter vtraſ<expan>

That warre began about the 32. yeare of Rome, and therefore <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaying that it was after the 300. ſaith, that which is true, not purpoſing there to ſet downe by a ſtraight and exact account, the verie iuſt yere wherein it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: but to geſſe much about the time by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen &amp; readie number keeping within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of truth.</p>
               <p>In <hi>A.

What is the cauſe of this difference betwixt <hi>Gellius</hi> and other? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not any fault of the authors iudgement, but onely a ſlippe of the writers pen, putting <hi>vigeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum nonum</hi> in ſtead of <hi>decimum nonum.</hi> 29. for 19. as may bee prooued by two reaſons: Firſt becauſe immediatlie after thoſe wordes, <hi>Gellius</hi> together with the beginning of that warre yoketh the yeare wherein <hi>A. Poſthumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was Dictator of Rome, who killed his own ſon, for that with great courage he went ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further in fighting againſt the enemie tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his father had appointed. This yeare of <hi>A. Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humius</hi> his Dictatorſhip, by <hi>Liuie</hi> is the 323. of Rome: but by <hi>A. Gellius</hi> &amp; ſome other ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the building of that Cittie in the ſecond yeare of the ſeauenth Olympiad, and the firſt Conſuls in the 242. of Rome, it is the 320. run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together with the firſt yeare of the Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſian war for the greateſt part of it, though not wholly, becauſe the war began ſomewhat before in the 319. Another reaſon may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from that which followeth a little after in the ſame chapter, concerning the time of the new gouernment of the Athenian common wealth by 30. tyrants, being as wee are taught
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9226:54"/>
by <hi>Xenophon</hi> the 28. yeare of the Peloponneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an war, which <hi>A. Gellius</hi> referreth to the 347. of Rome, from which ſumme 28. according to <hi>Xenophons</hi> reckoning, being taken away there remayneth the 319. of the Citie for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that warre. As for <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> it is vntrue that he referred the beginning of that warre to the third of the 87. Olympiad: for in flat wordes hee acknowledgeth <hi>Thucidides</hi> the cheefe of all other authors for it, to referre it to the firſt of that Olympiad: neither is there againſt it in <hi>Diodorus</hi> anie thing to be found.</p>
               <p>As the beginning of that war is vncertaine, ſo the end hath as much controuerſie. I thinke euen ſo, that is iuſt none at all, if Authors may bee ſuffered to ſpeake for themſelues, to open their meaning, and declare their minde: but let vs ſee this great controuerſie. The greateſt part of authors, ſaith <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> taught that war to haue continued 27. yeares. Yet <hi>Aemilius Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> ſaith, it laſted but 26. And <hi>Xenophon</hi> giueth it 28. and a halfe, here is great ods. The wordes of <hi>Aemilius probus</hi> are theſe in the life of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander: Lyſander Lacedaemonius magnam reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit ſui famam, magis foelicitate quàm virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem partam. Athenienſes enim in Peloponneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os ſexto &amp; viceſſimo anno bellum gerentes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feciſſe apparet. Id qua ratione conſequutus ſit latet. Non enim virtute ſui exercitus, ſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modestia factum eſt aduerſariorum. Quid quod
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9226:54"/>
dicto audientes ſuis imperatoribus non erant, diſpalati in agris relictis nauibus in hoſtium peruenerunt poteſtate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Quo facto Athenienſes ſe Lacedaemoniis dediderunt. Lyſander</hi> the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian (ſaith he) left a great fame of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which he got rather by good lucke then proweſſe: for it is well knowne that he ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Athenians, hauing made warre againſt the Peloponneſians ſixe and twentie yeres, but how hee obtained, this is not ſo apparent: for this happened not by the manhood of his owne armie: but the diſorder of the Athenians, who not ruled by their captaines, but ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad from their ſhips, came into their enemies power; which being done the Athenians yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelues. There are three ſeuerall times ſet downe by good Authors for the end of this warre. One was <hi>Lyſanders</hi> victorie by ſea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Athenians at a towne in Helleſpont called <hi>Aegos Potamoi,</hi> that is, Gotes floud, where <hi>Lyſander</hi> eſpying his oportunitie, when the Athenians leauing their ſhips had gone to the townes there about for prouiſion of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, ſodainely ſet vppon them, and tooke to the number of a hundred and foure ſcore, euerie one except eight or nine, which by flight eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away. Hee tooke alſo 3000. men with their Captaines, beſides a great number ſlaine, which thing being done &amp; the ſpoyle taken, he returned with minſtrelſie and great mirth; hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9226:55"/>
as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, atchieued a great matter with a litle labour, and in an houre ſpace made an end of a long warre. From the beginning of the war to this ouerthrow, whereby the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians power was nowe ſo weakned, that they could not hold out any longer, and ſo an ende made of that warre as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth: where about 26. yeares, and therefore <hi>Aemilius Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> reſpecting that time, as by his owne words manifeſtly appeareth, his account is true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thucidides</hi> with the greateſt part of writers for the end of that warre goe about a yeare fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the peace concluded with the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the pulling downe of their walles: ſo making the continuance 27. as before is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. So there is as much diſagreement between theſe two times ſet for the Peloponneſian war, the one by <hi>Thucidides,</hi> the other by <hi>Aemilius Probus:</hi> as there is difference betwixt theſe two waies, the one from London to Ware, the other from London to Hodsdon, and thence to Ware.</p>
               <p>If meaning may be taken without cauelling at wordes, the like may bee ſayd of <hi>Xenophon:</hi> not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding what ſoeuer <hi>Beroaldus</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> credit of his hiſtorie before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, in regard of ſome coruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which in his pinion hath happened in the notes and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Olympiads and yeares. <hi>Xenophon</hi> (ſaith hee) referreth the 93.

wherein <hi>Enarchippus</hi> was Ephorus at Sparta. After whom in the ſame hiſtorie the next is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Pantaeles,</hi> ordeyned Ephorus in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 22. yere of the Peloponneſian warre: which beeing ſo the yeare of <hi>Enarchippus,</hi> that is <hi>Pantacles, Pyteas, Archytas, Endicus:</hi> in whoſe yeare <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> the war being ended, and the walles of Athens throwen downe, returned home; by this meanes it muſt expire at the 25. yeres end. Contrarie whereunto <hi>Xenophon</hi> affirmeth in plaine wordes, that <hi>Lyſander</hi> went home after 28. yeares and ſixe months, an end being made of that war in the 29. yeare thereof: for which cauſe he alſo numbereth 29. Spartan Magiſtrats vnder whom the warre continued.</p>
               <p>Thus far <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> for anſwere whereunto I will firſt ſet downe the wordes of <hi>Xenophon</hi> as they lie: whereby it may appeare what <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons</hi> meaning was.

                  </gap> &amp;c. And this yeare ſaith <hi>Xenophon</hi> expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wherein the Medes alſo rebelling againſt <hi>Darius</hi> king of the Perſians became his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects againe. In the yeare following the temple
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9226:56"/>
of <hi>Minerua</hi> in Phocaea by the fall of a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt was ſet on fire. After winter was ended <hi>Pantacles</hi> being Ephorus, and <hi>Antigenes</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rule at Athens. In the beginning of the ſpring, when 22. yeares of the warre were paſt, the Athenians ſayled to Proconeſus with all their Armie. Thence moouing to Chalcedon and Byzantium, &amp;c. In their wordes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the acts of three diuers yeres. One of the Medes rebellion againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> which was the 24. Another of Mineruas temple burning when <hi>Pantacles</hi> was Ephorus; beeing the yeare following, that is the 25. The third of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians ſayling to <hi>Proconneſus</hi> after 22. yeres paſt of the Peloponneſian war, which was the 23. and therefore before theſe wordes. <hi>In the beginning of the ſpring, &amp;c.</hi> I haue ſet a full point to diſtinguiſh them from the former, as pertayning to a diuers yeare: for here <hi>Xenophon</hi> goeth backe againe to that which had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two yeares before. A thing vſuall enough in writers, when they will make their hiſtorie with more conſequence &amp; coherence the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hang together, to goe backe from one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to another before omitted, and ſo to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it on an end without interruption. I need not goe farre for examples in <hi>Xenophon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if it were a thing to be ſtood vpon.</p>
               <p>This for <hi>Xenophons</hi> meaning after ſome dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reading and peruſing the place was my
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9226:56"/>
iudgement, wherin afterward I was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> and <hi>Codoman.</hi> For <hi>Codoman</hi> in the fourth booke of his Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, very flatlie affirmeth that theſe wordes in <hi>Xenophon; In the beginning of the ſpring, &amp;c.</hi> begin the 23. yeres of the Peloponneſian war: yea he is ſo farre from thinking with <hi>Beroaldus</hi> the yeare of <hi>Pantacles</hi> gouerning, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly before mentioned to be all one with this: that he remooueth it two yeares off, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one whole yeare betwixt them as I doe: yet differing herein that he placeth <hi>Pantacles</hi> in the 21. yere, which was his error, as more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by God his aſſiſtance ſhall appeare hereafter. But the teſtimonie of <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtoriographer, is much more notable, who in his thirteenth booke referreth theſe acts which heere in <hi>Xenophon</hi> begin after the 22. yeare of the warre, to the 23. of the ſame two yeares before the Magiſtracie of <hi>Pantacles,</hi> which by <hi>Diodorus</hi> is ſet downe in the 25. yere thereof, which without all queſtion is moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true; and ſhewed by <hi>Xenophons</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Spartan gouernours euidently and plainely, as euery one whoſe ſight is not dimme with a cauelling affection and wilfull wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling may very clearely ſee it.</p>
               <p>If any thing in the writing of <hi>Xenophons</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie by corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of numbers be amiſſe, as for my part, I thinke there is none at all, if hee bee
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:9226:57"/>
well vnderſtood: yet for one thing amiſſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other which is true muſt not bee forſaken. Let that which is right be ſo ſtill, and not caſt away for that which is wrong. <hi>Xenophons</hi> table is ſure, and hath the conſent of excellent Authors to approue it.</p>

                  <hi>Thucidides</hi> from the Marathon war, which by the learned is ſet in the ſecond ſommer of the 72. Olympiad, to the end of the Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſian warre, maketh account of 87. yeares, that is to ſay, 10. to <hi>Xerxes</hi> inuading Greece, and 50. thence to the Peloponneſian war, with 27. more to the end thereof, which from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of 72. fill vp <hi>Xenophons</hi> number of 93. Olympiads. In the laſt whereof by <hi>Xenophon</hi> were gouernours of Athens; firſt, <hi>Enctemo,</hi> then <hi>Antigones,</hi> next <hi>Callias,</hi> the fourth and laſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs here a little examine how <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus,</hi> in the ſeauenth booke of his Roman Antiquities agreeth to theſe, there hee writeth that <hi>Callias</hi> ruled at Athens, in the third yeare of that 93. Olympiad, which is ſo by <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon.</hi> Moreouer that the next before <hi>Callias</hi> for the ſecond yere of that Olympiad, was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigenes,</hi> found true in the like manner by <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> and laſtlie from the ſecond yere of the 72 Olympiad, wherein the Marathon battell was fought, to that yeare of <hi>Callias</hi> he gathereth 85. yeares: which with that yeare of <hi>Callias,</hi> &amp; the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:9226:57"/>
other following of <hi>Alexias,</hi> make vp exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the iuſt reckoning of <hi>Thucidides</hi> his 87.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> for <hi>Xenophons</hi> meaning may take all doubt away, &amp; end the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, who agreeing with <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as well of Olympiads, as yeares of the Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſian warre, referreth the 24. of that war to the firſt of the 93. Olympiad, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> doeth, and in all the other yeares thereof wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth accordingly: wherefore the opinion of <hi>Beroaldus</hi> concerning the corruption of <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons</hi> numbers, I hold as true as his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 22. yeares for the next after 22. beeing paſt.</p>
               <p>Now touching the ſecond place of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> making the warre of longer continuance then <hi>Thucidides</hi> doeth: it no way hindereth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the Chronologie of thoſe times, if his wordes be well waied in the ſecond booke of his Greeke Hiſtorie: where after hee had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the laſt yeare of that warre, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous victorie of <hi>Lyſander</hi> againſt the Athenians at <hi>Gotes</hi> floud, and the beſiege of that City by ſea and by land, whereby they were driuen to yeeld and giue vp their ſhippes to the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, and to throw downe their long wals in the hauen <hi>Pyreus;</hi> hee addeth that the next yeare after happened that Olympiad, wherein <hi>Crocinas</hi> the Theſſalian won the race, and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> in Sparta, <hi>Pythodorus</hi> in Athens were
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:9226:58"/>
chiefe officers: In which the fame of the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an common wealth was changed, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Cittie committed to thirtie, who by their cruell tyrranie in the ſpace of eight months, killed more than before by warre had died in ten yeares. This being done ſaith <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, Lyſander</hi> ſayled to Samus, and tooke it, and reſtored the old inhabitants and driue out the new, &amp; after returned home to Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia with a great bootie in the end of ſummer, 28. yeares and ſixe months of that warre being then expired: In which time were 29. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates called Ephori: The firſt of them being <hi>Aeneſias,</hi> vnder who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the war began, &amp; the laſt <hi>Endius,</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſayled home. Here <hi>Xenophon</hi> fetcheth the beginning of that warre further than <hi>Thucidides,</hi> euen from the beginning of the firſt Ephorus, and for the end moſt apparantly goeth likewiſe beyond him to <hi>Lyſanders</hi> winning of Samus, &amp; ſetting order in it in the yeare of the 29. Ephorus: yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet hee ſtretcheth it, euen to <hi>Lyſanders</hi> comming home; vnto which time reckoning from the beginning of <hi>Aeneſias</hi> wee finde 28. yeares and a halfe.</p>
               <p>Againe <hi>Beroaldus</hi> obiecteth diſſention of Authors touching the beginning of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his tyrranie; ſome referring it to the third of the 93. Olympiad, ſome to the fourth. A waightie reaſon ſure for a little difference of one yeare in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9226:58"/>
                  <hi>Xenophon</hi> from other in one thing to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the credit of all ancient writers in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by vniuerſall conſent eſtabliſhed &amp; agreed vpon, and yet this little difference may bee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſhew then indeede; ſeeing it is a thing well knowne and confeſſed, that diuers wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters begin their yeares diuerſlie: ſome halfe a yeare, ſome verie nere three quarters before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as <hi>Gerardus Mercator</hi> prooueth in his Chronologie: but howſoeuer it were graunted that here in one yeare, there were flatte contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction betweene them: yet it is a ridiculous toy by one yeres difference to cut off a hundred from the Perſian Monarchie.</p>
               <p>I but <hi>A. Gellius</hi> hath yet a contrarie opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to both the former, laying the gouernment of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> on the 346. yere of Rome, which was the ſecond of that Olympiad. In <hi>Gellius</hi> we reade not 346. but 347. ſo that if the 346. of Rome be the ſecond of the 93. Olympiad, then the 347. is the third thereof, and therefore good agreement between the Storie writer of Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnaſſus and him. The Attick nights were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like too dark for <hi>Beroaldus</hi> his eyes, to ſee what the enditer layed vp in that place, whereunto I haue giuen light before to perceiue his minde.</p>
               <p>It followeth in <hi>Beroaldus.</hi> It is reported of <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Sophocles,</hi> that they both died in one yeare, that is the fourth of the 92. Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad: whereof may be gathered, the 30. tyrants ſet
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9226:59"/>
ouer Athens by <hi>Lyſander,</hi> and the ende of the Peloponneſian warre to haue beene in the firſt of the 93. becauſe the death of <hi>Sophocles</hi> is knowne to haue happened about that time. By whome is this reported? It were to bee wiſhed that he had beene named. Manie I am ſure they cannot be, and I thinke no one ancient Author at all can be found, who plainely hath ſaid it: ſo as it may appeare to haue proceeded of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in him, and againe if any can bee founde, who of iudgement ſet them both together ſo high: yet that might bee well enough without miſplacing the thirtie tyrants, from the firſt of the 94. Olympiad, to the firſt of the 93. Let vs goe on to the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solinus</hi> telleth that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> came into I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie in the time of the firſt Conſuls. <hi>Gellius</hi> in the time of <hi>Tarquinius ſuperbus,</hi> which might bee the yeare before. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſaith that hee taught in Italie after the 50. Olympiad, which diſſenteth neyther from that former ſaying of <hi>Solinus,</hi> nor the other of <hi>Gellius,</hi> becauſe the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes by them named, were both after the 50. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad. <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> writeth, that hee flouriſhed in the 60. Olympiad. All this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> wherein he liued &amp; taught, may ſtand well enough without diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. <hi>Plinie</hi> putteth him backe from the time named by <hi>Solinus</hi> an hundred yeares and more. And <hi>Beroaldus</hi> bringeth him as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9226:59"/>
or more forward euen to the Peloponneſian warre, by his opinion begun about the 94. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad: which beeing ſo, needes muſt <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo bee pulled forwarde in ſome proportion from the 55. Olympiad to the 80.</p>
               <p>Betweene theſe two extreamities of opinion concerning the age of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> the one of <hi>Plinie,</hi> the other of <hi>Beroaldus;</hi> in my iudgement <hi>medium tenuêre beati,</hi> the merry meane is beſt as we ſee, eſpecially beeing approoued by a farre greater number of the learned.</p>
               <p>But let vs examine his proofe that <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> was ſo late. His firſt reaſon is brought from the authoritie of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who in his tenth book <hi>De praeparatione Euangelica,</hi> writeth that <hi>Xenophons</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> were in the ſame times with <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> who came within the compaſſe of the Peloponneſian war. If an old man may liue at the ſame time with a young man, this is no good proofe to bring <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> to the Peloponneſian warre, becauſe <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> ſayde that <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> liued was in it. Let <hi>Euſebius</hi> bee his owne interpreter in his Chronicles, where hee putteth the matter out of doubt, ſetting the death of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> threeſcore and foure yeres at the leaſt before the beginning of the Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſian war, &amp; yet withall, making <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorus</hi> who ſaw that war to flouriſh in his dayes. Another reaſon of his much like to the former
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:9226:60"/>
is this. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> with diuers of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance beeing in the houſe of <hi>Milo:</hi> certaine enemies in deſire of reuenge vppon ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued griefe, burned it ouer their heads, where <hi>Lyſis</hi> &amp; <hi>Archytas,</hi> two of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers at that time eſcaped. This <hi>Lyſis</hi> after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came teacher of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the valiant The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban Captaine, who fighting at Mantine in the ſecond yeare of the 104. Olympiad aboue 40. yeres after the Peloponneſian war was ſlaine.</p>
               <p>And what of all this? I know his concluſion, that this being ſo late an age wherein <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> died, whoſe maſter was <hi>Lyſis</hi> one of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his ſchollers: It muſt needes be that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himſelfe reached to the time of the Peloponneſian warre ſomewhat nere to <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas,</hi> and when was that warre? the end of it, if we may beleeue <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> was about the 100. Olympiad, and by that meanes <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> muſt bee brought to the 94. at the leaſt wherein it began, not much aboue 40. yeares before the raigne of king <hi>Phillip</hi> of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould ſtand to number all the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which would follow of this poſition (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, that one abſurde thing graunted, many other follow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it) it were a tedious thing to write or read; except peraduenture that beeing ſo ridiculous in themſelues, the moouing of laughter might
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:9226:60"/>
ſome way eaſe the readers toyle.</p>
               <p>But leauing this I will declare that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time made by auncient writers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his teaching, and <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> his learning of <hi>Lyſis;</hi> can no way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> may ſtand well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſtill in that place, where they haue ſet him. His death by <hi>Euſebius</hi> is put in the laſt yere of the 70. Olympiad. At which time <hi>Lyſis</hi> his ſcholler might bee 16. yeares of age, and liue foureſcore and eight yeares after, till hee was 104. yeares old in the beginning of the 93. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad. When <hi>Epaminondas</hi> might be of the age of ſixteene yeares, inſtructed before of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> in his old age. What one thing is there heere incredible, or not vſuall in thoſe times? <hi>Gorgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Leontinus</hi> much about the ſame times with <hi>Lyſis,</hi> liued a hundred and nine yeares, which before hath beene ſhewed with diuers other like examples, and <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> in the life of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> teſtifieth of him, that beeing a yong man, hee was inſtructed in Philoſophie by <hi>Lyſis</hi> in the time of his graue and ſeuere old age. <hi>Philoſophiae praeceptorem habuit Lyſim Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentinum, Pythagoreum: cui quidem ſic fuit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus, vt adoleſcens tristem &amp; ſeuerum ſenem omnibus aequalibus ſuis in familiaritate antepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aemilius.</hi> Thus <hi>Beroaldus</hi> his ſharpe aſſault againſt the Chronologicall forte of the Grecians account, hath not ſo preuailed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:9226:61"/>
to batter it, but that it can defend it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemie.</p>
               <p>Let vs now ſee with what ſucceſſe hee hath oppugned the Latine Storie, againſt this hee fighteth with two weapons, one taken from the Roman Decemuirs, the other borrowed of the Frenchmen at their ſacking of Rome, in the 302. yeare of Rome, wherein <hi>L. Menenius,</hi> &amp; <hi>P. Seſtius</hi> were Conſuls, towardes the ende of their COnſulſhip, certaine Commiſſioners cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Decemuiri, were choſen by the people to the gouernment of the Citie and the making of Lawes, againſt the next yere now approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beeing the 303. of the Citie. Hereof is that difference and diſſention of ſome Authors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themſelues alleadged by <hi>Beroaldus:</hi> ſome referring the Decemuirs to the 302. yeare of Rome, reſpecting the time wherein they were elected, as <hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Liuie,</hi> ſome to the 303. becauſe that was the yeare wherein they firſt executed that new authoritie, beeing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and choſen vnto it in the end of the former yeare. As <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> in his eleuenth booke declareth. Beſides <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arro</hi> &amp; <hi>Onuphrius</hi> As for <hi>A. Gellius</hi> and ſome other, naming the 300. yeare of Rome for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemuirs, the cauſe thereof is manifeſt; that ſome make the time of the kings of Rome not 244. but onely 241. yeres, and thoſe began from the ſecond of the ſeauenth Olympiad, not the firſt,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:9226:61"/>
that is from the end of the building of Rome, when <hi>Romulus</hi> tooke vpon him to be king. By their opinion there are two yeres fewer than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account of; ſo that their 300. is the 302. of other, whereof I haue ſpoken before, by reaſon of ſome like examples in <hi>Gellius,</hi> who followed that reckoning: ſo there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe indeed, but onely in ſhew and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reſpects. Theſe ten Commiſſioners held that authority by the ſpace of two whole yeres. In the latter whereof being the 304. of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>Virginia</hi> a beautifull maide of Rome was ſlaine by her own Father, with a butchers knife taken from his ſtall in the open ſtreete, rather then that ſhee ſhould ſatisfie the filthie luſt of <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> one of the ten, who by great violence and open wrong went about it. <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> in his ſecond booke <hi>de finibus,</hi> writeth that this happened in the threeſcore yeare after the beginning of the firſt Conſuls, which was not the 301. of Rome as <hi>Beroaldus</hi> ſaith, making diſſention betweene Authors where there is none at all, but the 304. for adding threeſcore to the 244. wherein the laſt king was expelled, the ſumme is 304.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we ſay then to <hi>Dionyſius Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licarnaſſaeus,</hi> who is contrarie to himſelfe in his ſecond book, affirming thoſe ten Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners to haue beene in the 300. yeare of Rome? Euen this, that it is an increaſe of <hi>Beroaldus</hi> his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:9226:62"/>
for there ſpeaking of the Lawes which <hi>Romulus</hi> the firſt king ordained, and namely of that whereby it was made lawfull for a father to ſell his owne child: that this Law ſaith hee, was not made by the Decemuirs, who three hundred yeres after were appointed to that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, it is gathered by this ordinance of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. Patri poſt hac nullum ius esto vendendi filium;</hi> let it not be lawfull hereafter for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſell his ſonne. It is manifeſt in this place that the 300. yeare is accounted, not from the building of the Citie: but from the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Romulus</hi> eſtabliſhed the common wealth with lawes, which was after the foundation of the Citie layed. Otherwiſe this hiſtoriographer moſt vndoubtedly, perfectly, and exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the yere of their authoritie to be the 303 of the Citie.</p>
               <p>Thus there is no cauſe at all for <hi>Beroaldus</hi> ſo earneſtly, &amp; with ſuch heat, to complaine of great ignorance, and diſagreement in theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors one from an other, beeing in truth at great concord betweene themſelues, and diſſenting only in ſhew, and yet all the diſſention which he nameth, if it were ſo indeede, conſiſteth within the ſpace of three or foure yeares betwixt 300. and 303.</p>
               <p>But that all theſe are wide from the true time of the Decemuirs, in his opinion aboue three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeares: hee can prooue both by prophane
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:9226:62"/>
ſtorie, and holy ſcripture.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Beroaldus</hi> can doe this, I will ſay hee is a cunning iugler, let vs ſee how. <hi>Hermodorus</hi> the Epheſian, the interpreter of the Decemuirs lawes, was acquainted with <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and flouriſhed in his dayes, and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> citing the writings of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> muſt needes be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> Againe <hi>Pythagoras</hi> reached to the times of the Peloponneſian warre, as may be prooued by this, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> one of his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar friendes, inſtructed <hi>Epaminondas</hi> in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, who died long after that warre. Heereof we may conclude that <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> his friende with him flouriſhed in the time of the Peloponneſian warre, and that the Decemuirs lawes are there to bee placed.</p>
               <p>The fingering of this feate is too groſie to deceiue any mans eyeſight, who is but carefull to marke ſomewhat nerelie. Firſt this is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing proofe, that <hi>Heraclitus</hi> was later than <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> becauſe hee alleadgeth ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence out of his workes, for it is an vſuall thing for thoſe which are of one ſtanding, as wee ſay, and equall in time, to read the bookes one of another. <hi>Cicero</hi> liued in the ſame age with <hi>Varro,</hi> yet notwithſtanding he had recourſe to his writings, and alleadged vppon occaſion the contents thereof.</p>
               <p>The other argument touching <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his reaching to the Peloponneſian warre, by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:9226:63"/>
                  <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> being the mayne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all, is as vayne as that; which a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue made playne.</p>
               <p>Laſtlie though it were graunted, that <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> and <hi>Hermodorus</hi> were in the time of the Peloponneſian warre: yet for all that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemuirs lawes might be before that time inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the ſame <hi>Hermodorus;</hi> as well as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Beza</hi> his firſt interpretation of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, was many yeares before the late ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Calis by the Spanyards; and yet the ſame light of God his Church at thoſe dayes ſtill ſhining therein. This is ſuch a ſorie Sorites, as maketh me meruaile what conceite came in <hi>Beroaldus</hi> his head to bring it. As likewiſe that colde coniecture out of <hi>Liuie</hi> which followeth concerning the twelue tables of the Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uirs lawes, to be in the 370. yeare of Rome, is as farre and further from <hi>Liuies</hi> minde, in playne wordes otherwhere declared, as threeſcore is from three.</p>
               <p>The ſecond weapon wherewith <hi>Beroaldus</hi> fighteth againſt the Latine hiſtorie, is ſome doubt concerning the time of the French mens taking Rome, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 365. yeare from the building of that citie, and the firſt of the 98. Olympiad. For <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Camillus,</hi> hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the receaued opinion concerning the time thereof, that it happened a few more then 360. yeares after Rome was builded, addeth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:9226:63"/>
this doubting ſpeech: If it ſeeme credible, that an exact account of theſe times had been ſo long preſerued; ſeeing that euen the confuſion of that time, hath brought ſome doubt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie to other later.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> leaſt hee ſhould ſeeme without cauſe to haue made that doubt, bringeth this reaſon: that the fame and rumor of that warre wherein Rome by the French was taken, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie was ſpread abroad in Greece, and came to the eares of <hi>Heraclides Ponticus,</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle:</hi> whereby may bee gathered that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the time of king <hi>Phillip</hi> of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, in whoſe dayes thoſe authors liued ſaith <hi>Beroaldus.</hi> The raigne of this king began about the 105. Olympiad, ſeuen and twentie yeares after the common receaued time of that taking of Rome ſet by other, and endured full foure and twentie yeares.</p>
               <p>For anſwer to this doubt, I am to let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnderſtand, that the French men diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and vnquiet in minde for their ill ſucceſſe at their taking of Rome, being driuen out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and all their pray taken from them by <hi>Marcus Furius Camillus,</hi> came diuers times after into Italie, and namely in the 406. yeare of Rome, being the fourteenth of <hi>Philip</hi> the Macedonian King; when <hi>Aristotle</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout foure and thirtie yeares olde. In this yeare <hi>Lucius Furius Camillus</hi> being Conſull, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:9226:64"/>
he alone Conſull after his fellowes death: the French inuaded Italie with a mightie power. Amongſt them one at that time for ſtature of bodie paſſing other, chalenging any one of the Romane hoſte whoſoeuer durſt fight with him, was with the Conſuls leaue ſet vpon by <hi>M. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius,</hi> a valiant Captaine. In this combate a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen came ſuddainely to the Romane champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſat vpon his Helmet, and flew vpon the French man, againſt his face with bill and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents fighting, till at the length being greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed thereat, he was ſlaine by <hi>Valerius.</hi> Who thereof tooke name to bee called <hi>Coruinus,</hi> in memorie of the rauens fighting for him; which was interpreted to haue come from God. The French men after the death of their champion ſo miraculouſlie ſlaine, were diſcomfited and fled, and durſt not of a long time after come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Romans. And this was the battaile by all likeliehoode, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides Ponticus</hi> ſpake of. For it is confeſſed by <hi>Plutarch</hi> himſelfe, that the conquerer of the French at that time was called <hi>Lucius</hi> in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle;</hi> which agreeth to this time wherein <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Camillus</hi> was Conſull alone, and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: not to the taking of Rome, when <hi>Marcus Camillus,</hi> father to this man had giuen them the ouerthrow.</p>
               <p>As for the taking of Rome then mentioned by <hi>Heraclides</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which was by a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:9226:64"/>
rumor and vncertaine reporte noyſed abroad: the cauſe thereof might bee, that they were the ſame people then vanquiſhed, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had taken it. So it is true in regarde of the men.</p>
               <p>One argument more is yet behinde, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as may ſeeme to the laſt place, as of all the reſt moſt forcible to diſturbe the ſet boundes of the Peloponneſian warre, and thereby thoſe of the Perſian Empire. The force of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the conceite of <hi>Beroaldus</hi> is ſo ſtrong and pythie, as that it cannot poſſibly ſuffer the ancient accounte of thoſe times to ſtand. Let vs (ſaith <hi>Beroaldus</hi>) firſt ſet downe, that which is reported by <hi>Polybius</hi> a graue author in his firſt booke: that the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians hauing gotten the ſoueraigne Empire of Greece, by their victorie againſt the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in the ende of the Peloponneſian warre, ſcarſe held it by the ſpace of twelue yeares after. In the next place this wee are to knowe, that the ſame Lacedemonians were ſpoyled of that their Empire by the Thebans, in the famous battaile fought betweene them at Leanctra, in the ſecond yeare of the 102. Olympiad: whereof this for a certaintie followeth; that the Peloponneſian warre ended about the time of the 100. Olympiad. For it is manifeſt by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that the ende of it was in an Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picke yeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:9226:65"/>This is the reaſon of all other ſo ſure, vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſtrong, in the opinion of <hi>Beroaldus:</hi> but in very deede as friuolous, ridiculous, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, as euer any was framed. To make good my ſaying, let the author himſelfe ſpeake with his owne words: which be theſe, not farre from the beginning of his firſt booke. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Lacedemonians (ſayth <hi>Polybius</hi>) ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many yeares for the ſoueraignetie of Greece, after they had once gotten it, kept it ſcarſelie twelue yeares entire without trouble and loſſe. Indeede if <hi>Polybius</hi> had ſayde, that the Lacedemonians had quite and cleane loſt their whole dominion, within twelue yeares after they had obtained it, as <hi>Beroaldus</hi> maketh him ſay, the reaſon which hee vſeth had been good, to bring the ende of the Peloponneſian warre within three yeares of his reckoning: (ſo much hee is wide after his wonted manner) for they were wholie ſpoyled of that cheeftie, by <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas,</hi> generall of the Theban armie, in the ſecond of the 102. Olympiad. From which the twelfth yeare backward, is the third before the 100. Olympiad, and the ſecond of the 99.</p>
               <p>But there is as much difference betwixt the authors word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the interpretation of <hi>Beroaldus:</hi> as betweene breaking a mans head and killing him out right. It is true, and that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:9226:65"/>
which <hi>Polybius</hi> ment, that the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, about twelue yeares after <hi>Lyſanders</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie againſt the Athenians at Aegos Potamoi, whereby they became Lordes of Greece, loſt much of their dominion by the valour of <hi>Conon</hi> an Athenian Captaine, who ouercame the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians in a battel by ſea, &amp; toke fiftie of their ſhippes, and 500 of their men, whereby diuers Cities fell from the Lacedemonians vnto him as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> declareth in his four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth booke, yet for all this they ſtood ſtill, &amp; recouered much again afterward, til at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length they were vtterly diſpoſſeſſed of all by the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans, who gaue them a deadly blow. Heereby it appeareth that it was no part of <hi>Polybius</hi> his meaning, to make only twelue yeares from the end of the Peloponneſian war, to the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians vtter ouerthrow: but to that conqueſt of <hi>Conon</hi> ouer them by ſea fight before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>And if this bee not enough to make that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare ſufficiently, <hi>Polybius</hi> himſelfe yet once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſhall make it manifeſt, and all gaineſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as dumbe as a fiſh, which would gather by his teſtimonie, that the fielde at Leuctra was fought within 12. yeares after the Peloponneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an warre: for within one leafe after the former ſentence, he declareth that the battaile at Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctra was nor twelue, but 34. yeares after that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Aegos Potamoi, whereby they won the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:9226:66"/>
ſoueraigntie of Greece that is to ſay, 18. to the Frenchmens taking of Rome, and ſixteene more afterwarde to the fight at Leuctra, and that not obſcurely or in a riddle: but very flatly in plaine words, though not vnderſtood by the Biſhop of Sipontu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who for theſe words of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is after the battaile by ſea at Aegos Potamoi, tranſlated <hi>Poſt Xerxem a Cymone ſuperatum.</hi> After <hi>Xerx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> was ouercome by <hi>Cymon,</hi> which was long before the time ſpoken of by <hi>Polybius,</hi> and no part of his meaning at all.</p>
               <p>By this one place may bee ſeene what into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ſhifting hath beene vſed of <hi>Beroaldus</hi> to make his matter good, affirming Authors to ſay that which they neuer meaned, yea which they are as flat and plaine in manifeſt words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, as may be. But euery vaine color, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable ſhew is good enough for ſuch as are diſpoſed to wrangle out new deuiſes by cauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sophiſtrie.</p>
               <p>As for that which followeth out of <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> to prooue that aſſertion of <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> it hath neyther head nor foote, and is vnworthie of an anſwere, and therefore I purpoſe not to trouble the reader with my confuting ſuch pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſtuffe, except peraduenture ſome will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to frame it into an argument of ſome ſhew or color at the leaſt, then will I alſo profeſſe my skill to anſwere it, and to turne all againſt him
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:9226:66"/>
for the truth; as knowing <hi>Xenophon</hi> to haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his conceited opinion, but much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I haue particularly anſwered all the Sophiſticall elcnchs, and reaſonleſſe reaſons, &amp; vnproouing proofes of <hi>Beroaldus</hi> out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Hiſtories, one by one, wherewith to the trouble of God his Church, and the darkening of his worde, hee hath ſtuffed ſo many papers, without leauing any one to my knowledge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered, except the laſt out of <hi>Xenophon</hi> for the cauſe before declared. Touching his ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proofe ſo often vrged againſt the auncient Chronologers of the Perſian times, it ſhall by God his aſſiſtance appeare hereafter how vain it is. And thus much touching the firſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the chronologie of the Perſian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the ſecond, contayning 328. yeares and a halfe, not much vnder or ouer from the death of the laſt king of Perſia, to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt, the proofe hereof is good: for that Chriſt our bleſſed Redeemer was borne in the third yeare of the 194. Olympiad, <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> to omit the teſtimonies of other Fathers, declareth in his Chronicles, at this yeare and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad writing thus. Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God was borne in Bethleem of Iuda, in which yeare the ſaluation of Chriſtians began: which therefore is alſo counted the firſt yeare of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9226:67"/>
Chriſtians ſaluation. <hi>Darius</hi> the laſt king of the Perſians was ſlaine, neere the beginning of the third yeare of the 112. Olympiad. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is the number before declared. The ſame is prooued by the Chronologicall Hiſtorie of the yeares of Rome; the building whereof by <hi>Solinus, Dionyſius, Eratoſt henes,</hi> and other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Authors, is ſet in the firſt yeare of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Olympiad, the trueth whereof is teſtified by olde marble monuments digged out of the ground, and as <hi>Solinus</hi> writeth, was confirmed euen by the publike acts &amp; regiſters of Rome: wherein the 207. Olympiad was recorded to be in the 801. yeare of Rome, when <hi>Pompeius Gallus,</hi> and <hi>Q. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eranius</hi> were Couſuls: this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaldus</hi> himſelfe acknowledgeth, and bringeth reaſon for it. By this account then the third of the 194. Olympiad, wherein the birth of Chriſt is put, ſhould be the 751. of Rome, let vs now examaine whether this be ſo or no.</p>
               <p>The yeare after <hi>Caeſars</hi> death, wherein <hi>Herſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Panſa</hi> were Conſuls, &amp; <hi>Auguſtus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his raigne, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Chronicles, &amp; <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger</hi> in his fift book <hi>De emendatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne temporum</hi> declare, was the 710. of Rome, ſo witneſſed, not onely by <hi>Solinus</hi> in his Polyhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, but euen the very ancient Marble monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo, wherein was engrauen his record, at the 710 yeare of the Citie. <hi>In Panſae occiſi lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum factus eſt C.

Olympiad: So that to and fro the ſame ſeaſon of the yeare, the diſtance being reckoned, was iuſt ſo much, that is to ſay 294. yeares, which is likewiſe verified by an eye witneſſe of thoſe times, whereof hee writeth, and flouriſhing in them, that is, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius Halicarnaſſaeus,</hi> who in the Preface to his Roman antiquities, telleth not by heareſay, but of knowledge, that he came into Italy when <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> had made an ende of ciuill warres, about the middeſt of the 187. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad. The time which he meaneth, was that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſars</hi> conqueſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Antonius</hi> in Egypt, in the moneth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, not farre from the beginning of the third yere of that Olimpiad which he nameth: being indeed (as hee ſaith) neere the middeſt of that foure yeares Olympick ſpace, vnto which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting from the firſt yere of the 114. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Alexander</hi> died, we finde that number of the former Authors in <hi>Clemens</hi> euen 294. yeres.</p>
               <p>The truth hereof is yet further confirmed by <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> for exact accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of times exceeding skilfull, who in the third book of his Almageſt, maketh the diſtance betweene the death of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> and the Monarchie of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> 294.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9226:69"/>
Egyptian yeares. The account whereof began with the beginning of their firſt moneth called Toth, as <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> declareth in his booke <hi>de die natali,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger</hi> in diuers places, which at that time fell about the twelfth day of our Nouember. So long after the ſommer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherein <hi>Alexander</hi> died, the Egyptians began their account of yeares after his death. Theſe 294. Egyptian yeres from the twelfth of Nouember, expire not in the twelfth of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember againe, but in the 29. day of Auguſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and reach iuſt as farre as the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Roman yeares doth, being begun from the 29. day of Auguſt before going. The cauſe whereof is this, that the Egyptian yeare is ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Roman by ſix houres, or one fourth part of a day, which in ſo many yeres breedeth the loſſe and difference of threeſcore and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dayes and a halfe.</p>
               <p>So there is no diſagreement betweene the old writers in <hi>Clemens</hi> reckoning after the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man manner, and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> following the Greeke account, and <hi>Ptolomie</hi> numbring by the vſuall cuſtome of the Egyptians: except this, that <hi>Ptolomie</hi> reſpected the verie end of that war, in the taking of <hi>Alexandria</hi> &amp; Egypt in theende of that month after <hi>Antonius</hi> was ſlaine, the other goe ſomewhat hier to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, wherein <hi>Antonius</hi> by the falling away of his nauie was quite vndone, and not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:9226:70"/>
able to ſtand out any longer. Vnto theſe 294. yeares betweene the Monarchies of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi> ſixe more being added, which had paſſed before <hi>Alexanders</hi> death, to the end of <hi>Darius,</hi> the number is made 300. yeares.</p>
               <p>For the truths ſake I may not here omit one error of <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger,</hi> notwithſtanding the reuerence and loue which I beare him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of his fruitefull paynes employed to the benefite of learning, and aduauncement of knowledge, whereby he hath well deſerued of God his Church; in his fift booke <hi>de emendatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne temporu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> ſpeaking of that victorie of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus Caeſar</hi> at Actium, which as (he ſaith) hapned in the third Conſulſhip of <hi>Augustus Caeſar,</hi> with <hi>Valerius Meſſala Coruinus,</hi> hee affirmeth that <hi>Ptolomie</hi> counteth vnto it from <hi>Nabona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> coronation 718. yeares fullie compleat, which commeth ſhort of my reckoning by a yeare: <hi>Ptolomie</hi> indeede counteth from <hi>Nabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſars</hi> coronation to the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> 424. yeares, and thence to <hi>Augustus</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie 294, which in all make 718. yet not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the conqueſt at Actium for the ende of thoſe yeares; for that was obtayned in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as <hi>Dio</hi> teſtifieth, beyond the compaſſe of <hi>Ptolomies</hi> preciſe reckoning, by foure or fiue dayes in regarde of the moneth. But to let that paſſe, it is plaine euen by his owne teſtimonie a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:9226:70"/>
little before in the ſame booke, in the chapter where he treateth of the firſt Thoth of the yeares of <hi>Alexanders</hi> death, that hee was deceaued here in his reckoning. His words there be theſe, <hi>Alexander deceſſit anno</hi> 424. <hi>diebus aestiuis.

But the Thoth following, is the beginning of the yeares from his death, in the twelft of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the firſt daye of the weeke, in the 4389. yeare of the Iulian period, in the firſt yeare of the 114. Olympiad. Let any now make the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of 294. Egyptian yeares, from the twelft of Nouember, in the firſt yeare of the 114. Olympiad, and hee ſhall ſtay and make his reſt toward the ende of Auguſt, in the third yeare of the 187. Olympiad: which was the yeare of <hi>Augustus Caeſars</hi> fourth Conſulſhip, wherein he got the ſole Empire of Rome into his hands, by the death of <hi>Antonius,</hi> as before is ſhewed, and not of his third Conſulſhip wherein hee got the victorie againſt <hi>Antonius</hi> at Actium, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> would haue it. <hi>Ptolomie</hi> therefore counteth from <hi>Alexanders</hi> death, not to the victorie at Actium, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith, but to <hi>Augustus</hi> his Monarchie, or to vſe <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> owne word, <gap reason="foreign">

which he had not entire till ſuch time as <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was diſpoſſeſſed of all.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe whereas <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian nauie was ouercome at Actium by <hi>Augustus,</hi> in the time of his third Conſulſhip with <hi>Coruinus,</hi> and that in the ſixteenth Iulian yeare: it cannot poſſiblie be ſo, becauſe the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Iulian yeare began together with the fourth Conſulſhip of <hi>Augustus.</hi> The firſt Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an yeare was the very next before <hi>Caeſars</hi> death, beginning at Ianuarie, in the 708. of Rome, and the third yeare of the 183. Olympiad, as <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> teacheth. Foure Olympiads, that is, ſixteene yeares thence continued, bring vs to the third of the 187. Olympiad: wherein <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> was Conſull the fourth time, and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Conſull with him was <hi>Licinius Craſsus,</hi> ſo as no part of it could fall to that battaile at Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, except we wil make it twice fought, once in the third Conſulſhip of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in his fourth the yeare after.</p>
               <p>The grounde of this error of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> was miſunderſtanding of <hi>Cenſorinus,</hi> as may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidentlie ſeene in his third booke, in the chapter of the Egyptian Actiac yeare, where his words are theſe: <hi>Cenſorinus ait annum Augustorum Actiacum 267. eſſe 1014. Iphiti &amp; 986. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonoſari:</hi> that is, <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> ſaith, that the 267 Actiac yeare of the Auguſts, was the 1014. of <hi>Iphitus,</hi> and the 986. of <hi>Nabonaſar. Cenſorinus</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:9226:71"/>
neither ſaide it nor thought it: hee maketh no mention of any Actiac yeare at all, but onely affirmeth that the 986. of <hi>Nabonaſar</hi> was the 265. of the yeares called Auguſts: the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof was taken from <hi>Augustus</hi> his ſeuenth, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ipſanius</hi> his third Conſulſhip ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of the Egyptians the 267. <hi>Quia bien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio ante in potestatem ditionemque populi Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani venerunt,</hi> becauſe they became ſubiect to the power &amp; dominion of the people of Rome two yeares before (ſaith <hi>Cenſorinus</hi>) ſpeaking not of the victorie at Actium, but of the ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Egypt: which after the death of <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> was conquered to the Romane Empire, and made a prouince a yeare after that ouerthrow of <hi>Antonius</hi> at Actium.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſee no cauſe why my former reckoning ought not to bee receaued as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true (whatſoeuer <hi>Scaliger</hi> may ſeeme to haue to the contrarie or any other:) that is to ſaye, that from the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> to the Monarchie of <hi>Augustus,</hi> in the yeare of his fourth Conſulſhip, were 294. yeares: and from the ſlaughter of the laſt king of Perſia, in the third yeare of the 112. Olympiad, which made <hi>Alexander</hi> an vndoubted Monarch, to the third of the 187, wherein the death of <hi>Antonius</hi> did the like to <hi>Augustus,</hi> were 300. yeares.</p>
               <p>Now that Ieſus Chriſt was borne in the 28. yeare of the Monarchie of <hi>Augustus,</hi> wherein
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9226:72"/>
after <hi>Antonius</hi> his death, he ruled alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the part taking or fellowſhip of any other with him therein, wee haue the teſtimonie of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus. 1. Stromat. Euſebius</hi> in the firſt booke of his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie, in plaine words confirming it., In the 42. yeare ſaith he, of the raigne of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and the 28. after the ſubdewing of Egypt, and the death of <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> in whom the raigne of the Egyptian kings, called Ptolomies was extinct; our Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt was borne in Bethleem of Iuda, <hi>Cyreneus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gouernour of Syria, and ſo forth.</p>
               <p>The 42. yeare of <hi>Augustus</hi> his parted raigne was all one with the 28. of his lone raigne. That began in the 710. of Rome: theſe 14. yeres after in the 724. of Rome; being the fifteenth of <hi>Augustus</hi> from his firſt beginning. For though the ciuill warres were ended by the death of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and the ſubdewing of Egypt, in the fourteenth yeare of <hi>Augustus,</hi> in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Auguſt: yet the yeares of his Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie after the manner of the Romans, began to bee reckoned from Ianuarie following, in the beginning of the next yeare, being his fifteenth. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Augustus</hi> the king of the Romanes attayning the fifteenth yeare of his raigne, got Egypt and the reſt of the world, ſaith <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his eyght

booke, <hi>de demonstratione Euangelij.</hi> And in his Chronicles likewiſe hee beginneth the Monarchie of <hi>Augustus</hi> from the ſame his fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeare. For foureteene yeares then paſt, being added to 28. following, the number is 42.</p>
               <p>The ſame beginning of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie from that yeere, is confirmed by <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Oroſius</hi> in the ſixt booke of his Hiſtorie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gentiles. Where hauing declared in the nineteenth chapter of that booke, that <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> now forſaken of their nauie, which in the beginning of Auguſt, had turned to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for griefe ſlew themſelues: And that <hi>Caeſar</hi> after paſſed from thence into Syria by land, and then into Aſia, and at length by Greece into Italie: in the next chapter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly he addeth that <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> in the yeare following, wherein himſelfe now the fift time and <hi>L.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger</hi> I can but maruaile at, in his ſixt book <hi>de emendatione temporum,</hi> affirming
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9226:73"/>
that Chriſt our Lorde was borne in the ſeuen and twentie yeare after the victorie at Actium, which is ſhort of the time by mee ſet for his birth in the 42. of <hi>Augustus,</hi> by two yeares and more. For the yeare of Chriſts birth was the 30. at the leaſt after the Actiac victorie 29. full yeares beeing paſt and almoſt foure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths.</p>
               <p>Now touching the moneth and daye of our Sauiours birth: I ſee no cauſe why we ought to referre that conſtant opinion of ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it was the 25. of December, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of <hi>Augustine, Oroſius, Chryſostom,</hi> and other, from them continued nowe by many ages to this daye, except direct proofe can be brought to the contrarie. Which <hi>Beroaldus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his wonted manner goeth about, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter of his fourth booke of Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles affirming in plaine words, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was borne in the middeſt of the moneth September, when the daye and night is of one length.</p>
               <p>His reaſon to proue that aſſertion of his, is in this manner. Chriſt preached three yeares and a halfe before his death, this is prooued by the words of <hi>Daniel</hi> in his ninth chapter. Hee ſhal confirme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couenant to many one weeke, and halfe that weeke ſhall aboliſh ſacrifice and offering: which ſaith <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of Chriſt, preaching three yeares and a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9226:73"/>
halfe from his baptizing to his death. Now that his baptiſme begun together with the 30. yeere of his age, is teſtified by <hi>Luke</hi> in his third chapter the 23. verſe where Chriſt is ſayd to haue entred the 30. yeere of his age when he was baptized. The end of the laſt halfe yeere wherein Chriſt dyed, being the 14. day of the Iewes Niſan and of our March: Leaue as well the begining thereof, as conſequently the birth of Chriſt, to the 14. of September.</p>
               <p>In deede if thoſe his interpretations of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> in theſe places, were both of them certaine and cleare, as he ſayeth they are, his proof were good: but if either of them faile, his reaſon is not worth a ſtrawe. And ſo farre they are from being both certaine, that neither of them both is ſure: <hi>Scaliger</hi> maketh it an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted thing, that they are otherwiſe to bee vnderſtood, referring the wordes of <hi>Daniell</hi> to the beſeging and warre againſt Ieruſalem by the Romanes, and making the time of Chriſtes preaching, not three yeeres and a halfe but full foure. <hi>Beda</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> made it onely three yeeres after his baptiſme. And <hi>Apollinaris</hi> with diuers other eyther on or two at the moſt. And as for the wordes of <hi>Luke,</hi> a preciſe &amp; exact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the thirtie yeere of Chriſtes age can not be gathered of them. Seeing hee vſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, importing a doubtfull and imperfect number, wherevnto ſomewhat, more or leſſe,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:9226:74"/>
may be added or taken away, and ſignifying that Chriſt begunne to bee about thirtie yeeres of age at the time of his baptiſme: As in our Engliſh bible it is well tranſlated, and ſo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtinus Martir,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> with ſome other of the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Wherfore this his beſt reaſon is too weake to pull backe the receaued time of Chriſtes birth, from the 25. day of December, to the 14. of September.</p>
               <p>An other argument of his is taken from the cuſtome of the Greeke and the Egyptian chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, beginning their yeare from September. Whence alſo the indictions haue their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This (ſaith <hi>Beroaldus</hi>) they did becauſe they knew that Chriſt was borne in the middeſt of September. And how proueth he that? <hi>Beroal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> for ſooth ſayth ſo. The mans bare yea was enough belike to perſwade the ſimple and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull. Other reaſon he bringeth none at all, either from authoritie or otherwiſe. Neither in deed do I ſee how he could poſſibly bring any. For it is a thing held without controuerſie, that the cauſe of the yeres beginning in the midſt of September, was the memorie not of Chriſtes birth, but of the glorious conqueſt of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> againſt <hi>Darius</hi> at Gaugamela, retained long after euen in the Greeke church. Which <hi>Scaliger</hi> out of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> declareth in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:9226:74"/>
booke, <hi>De emendatione temporum;</hi> the chapter of <hi>Calippus</hi> his period beginning in Autumne; and alſo in his fift booke, the chapter of the councell of Nice which by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> was ſet downe to haue bene in the 636. yeere of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what ſhall we need goe further then to <hi>Beroaldus</hi> himſelfe for confirmation hereof, who euen in the verie next Chapter before go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had prooued by the Greeke Canons, &amp; the firſt Tome of councels printed at Paris, that the Greeke church counted their yeres from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi> If the Greeke church counted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and that accompt of <hi>Alexanders</hi> yeeres begun in the Equinoctiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Autumne, as <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> teacheth, about mid September; how can the cauſe and cuſtome of this reckoning be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Chriſts natiuitie? as for the Egyptians, the firſt month of their yeere called Thoth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſubdewed by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> went through all the monthes and ſeaſons of the yere ſome times in Februarie, after in Ianuarie, and ſo in order to Februarie againe. But after <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> were ouerthrowen, and Egipt made one of the Roman prouinces, won by <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> in the month of Auguſt; the firſt of their Thoth was not the 14. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, nor any part of it, but the 29. of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt; and that in memorie not of Chriſt his birth being yet vnborne, but of <hi>Augustus</hi> his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:9226:75"/>
victory therein againſt the Egyptians. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo as before hath beene ſhewed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Sextilis, tooke a new name to bee called Auguſt.</p>
               <p>Now follow the indictions, which begunne about the 24. of September, and therefore by <hi>Beroaldus</hi> made likewiſe an argument of Chriſtes birth in that month. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of his father <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who died here in England at Yorke, obtayned the empire of Rome in the yeere of Chriſt 312. The time of his coronation being the 24. of September, was celebrated with much ioy, and great ſolemnitie, and many ſportes and games againſt that time proclamed: thereof called an Indiction, that is, a proclaming. And from that day in memorie thereof, a new accompt of yeeres begunne by that terme of Indiction. This accompt the church alſo obſerued. Yet beginning it later with the month Ianuarie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to make it agree with the yeeres of Chriſt. Therefore this argument of all other is moſt forcible againſt that, which <hi>Beroaldus</hi> being blinded with a new fangled conceipt brought it for; as euerie one may ſee which will open but indifferent eyes. For the 24. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, was 11. or 12. dayes after the <hi>aequinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium:</hi> wherein he ſetteth Chriſt his birth; and the cauſe thereof <hi>Conſtantine</hi> crowned, not Chriſt borne. And becauſe the time of Chriſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:9226:75"/>
his birth was in thoſe dayes celebrated and kept in winter and the beginning of the yerae of Chriſt in the firſt of Ianuarie, as now at this day it is with vs: the holy and zealous Chriſtian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that age in honour of Chriſt, changed the time of that Indiction from the 24. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember to the firſt of Ianuarie. Thus it pleaſeth the God of truth to blind the aduerſaries therof, that they may fight againſt themſelues which ſtriue againſt it.</p>
               <p>His laſt proofe is fetched from the courſe of <hi>Abiah,</hi> whereof <hi>Zacharie Iohn Baptiſts</hi> father was, as the Euangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifieth in the fift verſe of his firſt chapter. There were 24. cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Prieſts, ſeruing in the Temple at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, two families or courſes appointed for euerie moneth, in the firſt of Chronicles the 24 Chapter, (ſaith <hi>Beroaldus</hi>) the firſt of theſe courſes began moſt like in March, as other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges pertaining to the temple did: ſo the courſe of <hi>Abiah</hi> beeing the eight, falleth to Iune. In that moneth vnto <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſeruing in the Temple, was foretold the birth of <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> by an Angell. About that time then his wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conceaued, and ſixe moneths after the bleſſed virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> as is gathered by the 26. &amp; the 36. verſes of the firſt chapter of <hi>Luke:</hi> So the time of Chriſt conceaued falleth to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, and the ninth moneth after for his birth is September. All theſe linkes hang together

               <p>Wherefore I conclude that our glorious Lord and Redeemer Chriſt Ieſus, bleſſed be his name and his memorie for euer, was borne in the third yeare of the 194.

               <p>By that which hitherto hath beene prooued, it appeareth that from the beginning of the Perſian Monarchie, and the firſt yeare of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the end of the Iewes common wealth in the ſecond of <hi>

But why is it called <hi>Daniels</hi> citie? was it becauſe God had forſaken it, as though it were now to be called any others rather then Gods citie? So the learned father <hi>Hierom</hi> thought, but herein deceaued. For being a holy citie it muſt nedes bee alſo Gods citie. It was rather cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Daniels</hi> citie, ether of his birth or brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp therein. As in the ninth chapter of <hi>Mathew</hi> Capernaum is called Chriſts citie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dwelt in it.

               <p>By this which I haue ſayde of <hi>Daniels</hi> people and <hi>Daniels</hi> citie, it may appeare howe wide <hi>Hierom</hi> ſhot from the marke, with ſome other of the ancient fathers interpreting it as though God had forſaken both: and giuen them ouer as well the Iewes as Ieruſalem.</p>

               <p>This aboliſhing and finiſhing of ſinne, was wrought and fulfilled by our bleſſed Lord and redeemer Chriſt Ieſus. He was that vnſpotted lambe of God which tooke away the ſinnes of the world, the firſt of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 29. verſe. In the end of the world he once appeared to put away ſinne, by the ſacrifice of himſelfe. Hee was once offered to take away the ſinnes of many. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26.28. He waſhed vs from our ſinnes in his blood. In the firſt of the Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the 3. ver. He deliuered vs from ſinne. By him the bodie of ſinne is deſtroied, we are dead to ſinne, that it ſhould not haue dominion ouer vs. See the 6. chapter. to the Romans 6.11.14.18. verſes. Hee condemned ſinne in the fleſh. Whoſoeuer is borne of God can not ſin. Chriſt therefore fulfilled this heere ſpoken of by <hi>Daniell,</hi> that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Rom 8.3. 1.

                  <hi>To bring euerlaſting righteouſneſſe.]</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration hereof we haue in the epiſtle to the Hebrewes from the 12. ver. of the 10. chap. vnto the end of the 18. verſe of the ſame. There wee are taught that by the ſacrifice of Chriſt Ieſus once offered, remiſſion of ſinnes is obtained for euer: ſo as after there can be no other propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie oblation for them.</p>
               <p>Here therefore the euerlaſting righteouſnes of Chriſt, is oppoſed to the righteouſneſſe of the law, to the obtaining whereof dayly ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were offered. But Chriſt hauing once made reconciliation for our ſinnes by his blood: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:9226:82"/>
purchaſed vnto vs euerlaſting ſaluation and righteouſneſſe, which in the 9. chapter and 12. ver. of that Epiſtle is called euerlaſting redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The prieſthood of chriſt is euerlaſting.<note place="margin">Heb. 7.24. Heb. 9.11. Heb. 8.2. &amp; 9.11.12.</note> And of good thinges to come euerlaſting.

And laſtly the ſaluation, redemption, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which he purchaſed for vs is euerlaſting. So there is great difference betwene the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call prieſtes and Chriſt, and betweene their oblations and his ſacrifice. Of this effect in bringing righteouſneſſe, he hath this name to be called the Lorde our righteouſneſſe in the 23. chapter of the prophet <hi>Ieremie:</hi> the reaſon whereof is giuen by the bleſſed Apoſtle in the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians the firſt chapter and 30. verſe; where hee ſayth, that Chriſt was made righteouſneſſe vnto vs.</p>

                  <hi>To ſeale vp viſion and prophet.]</hi> A teſtament or couenant in writing is neuer ſure before the ſeale be ſet vnto it. That maketh all good. That confirmeth and giueth ſtrength. And therfore by a metaphor or borrowed ſpeach; to ſeale vp viſion and prophecie, is as much as to confirme the ſame. So the word is taken in the 3. chapter of <hi>Iohns</hi> goſpell and 33. verſe. He which receaueth his teſtimonie hath ſealed vp, that God is trewe, that is confirmed.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer in the old teſtament had been
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:9226:83"/>
foretold and promiſed by the holy prophets of God concerning Chriſt his birth, his redeeming the elect from thrall, and ſauing from ſinne, his forerunner, his preaching, his miracles, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, betraying for money, death, reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſcnceon, and glorious kingdome, were all moſt certainly performed by him in their dew time. The verifying and fulfilling whereof, was as it were a ſeale for ſure confirmation of the vndoubted truth thereof. And for this cauſe the time of viſion and prophet, is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to the comming of Chriſt and the cleare preaching of the goſpel in his kingdome, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was to verifie, confirme and fulfill the ſame. This we are taught in the beginning of the epiſtle to the Hebrewes in theſe wordes. God in times paſt ſpake often and many wayes to the fatheres by the prophets. But in theſe laſt dayes he hath ſpoken to vs by his ſonne.</p>

And this was the ceremonie of conſecrating them to the ſeruice of God in thoſe callinges. For the annointing of prieſtes we haue the commaundement of God in the laſt chapter of Exodus the 13. verſe where ſpeaking to <hi>Moſes</hi> of <hi>Aaron.</hi> Thou ſhalt (ſayeth God) annoint him and ſanctifie him, that hee may miniſter vnto me in the prieſtes office.

The Law, Prieſts, Prophets, and Kings were annoynted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall holy oyle, but Chriſt with the ſpirituall oyle of the holy Ghoſt, which in the 45.

The Popes holines ſtriueth with Chriſt about this tittle, at leaſt to be equal with him, challenging to himſelfe the name not to bee called holie, which were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a ſpotted man; but that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him, he will bee as good as Chriſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen moſt holie, yea holineſſe it ſelfe, or nothing at all.

Though ſome recko<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from his ſeuenth yeare, wherein <hi>Eſdras</hi> was ſent to Ieruſalem by the Kinges authoritie with great priuiledges graunted.</p>
               <p>Touching their opinion which bring the time of their yeares from <hi>Cyrus</hi> to Chriſt: it is with good reaſon confuted by <hi>Iulius Affrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in the fift booke of his Chronicles, becauſe that from <hi>Cyrus</hi> to Chriſt are many yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue that time, that the compaſſe of <hi>Daniels</hi> weeks can reach to, which may be likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected againſt <hi>Darius Hiſtaspis</hi> his ſecond yeare: from which to Chriſts birth are aboue 500. yeares.</p>
               <p>But all this reaſoning of <hi>Africanus</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Beroaldus</hi> no whit at all, bringing <hi>Cyrus</hi> downe from the 55.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:9226:93"/>
but other in his ſtead I know not who, ſuch as were neuer heard of before.</p>
               <p>If theſe fancies had beene broched before the dayes of <hi>Africanus:</hi> his anſwere I beleeue would haue beene, as is vſed amongſt the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>contra negantes principia,</hi> againſt ſuch as denie principles and grounds, not with words, but eyther with ſilence or hiſſing: as <hi>Ariſto</hi> &amp; <hi>Pyrrho</hi> were ſerued for making no difference betwixt riches and pouertie.

The true time of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his age and the Perſian Monarchie, which the Reader may ſafely leane to, is alreadie declared.</p>
               <p>The laſt opinion is of ſuch as referre the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 490. yeres of <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſie to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the longhanded, ſome reckning them from his ſeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>enth yeare, to the death and paſſion of Chriſt Ieſus; as <hi>Functius</hi> and ſome other. The ſeuenth of that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was the ſecond yeare of the 80. Olympiad, and our Sauiour ſuffered in the laſt of the 202. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betweene is 490. yeares; ſo that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the time and ſpace of yeares, this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:9226:94"/>
would in ſome ſort agree: if other things were anſwerable: but this is certaine that <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras</hi> was in that ſeauenth yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſent to Ieruſalem by the kings authoritie, with letters and many priueledges graunted vnto him, and great ſummes of monie for offerings and vſes of the Temple: yet no decree made for the building of the Citie, eyther Temple, which had bin finiſhed before, or walles which were made vp after by <hi>Nehemias,</hi> by ſpeciall commandement.</p>
               <p>Moreouer if the decree to build the Citie had beene then publiſhed in the ſeauenth yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> we muſt from thence to Meſſias onelie account ſeauen yeares, and ſixtie two as the Angell in plaine wordes declareth, which expire ſeauen yeeres, before the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtlie this opinion diſagreeth from the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of <hi>Ezra,</hi> where we read of an other <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> before this, vnder whom <hi>Ezra</hi> came to Ieruſalem, which had forbidden the Iewes to proceed in the building of God his Temple, &amp; therefore this could not bee the long handed <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> before whome there was no king of Perſia called by that name. Which reaſon likewiſe ſerueth to improue the next opinion here following: for manie goe ſomewhat lower to the 20. yere of the ſame <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a newe decree went out for the building of

the walles of Ieruſalem, as we reade in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter of <hi>Nehemias.</hi> This twentieth yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> was for the moſt part of it anſwerable to the 4. of the 83. Olympiad, and the commandement giuen in the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the beginning of the ſpring: as wee reade in the ſecond of <hi>Nehemias.</hi> From which time to the death and paſsion of our Sauiour in the ſpring time of the laſt yeare of the 202. Olympiad, were 477. yeares full and no more. So there wants of <hi>Daniels</hi> number thirteene yeares.</p>
               <p>To ſupply this want, two waies haue bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed. One by <hi>Iulius Africanus, Beda, Ruper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Comeſtor, Pererius,</hi> and other, who thought the yeares of the Moone to bee vnderſtood in this place. Which opinion, as of all other moſt fitlie agreeing to the true interpretation of this place, <hi>Pererius</hi> on the 9. of <hi>Daniel</hi> embraceth, and bringeth reaſon for it; becauſe it is ſayd in the Latin tranſlation 70. <hi>Hebdomadae abbreui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atae ſunt:</hi> that is, 70. weekes are ſhortened; <hi>Quo ſignificatur annos earu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hebdomadaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non eſſe ad longitudinem annorum ſolarium exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, ſed ad breuitatem lunarium coarctandos.</hi> Whereby is ſignified that the yeares of thoſe weekes are not to be driuen out to the length of the Sunne yeares: but to bee drawne into the ſhortnes of the Moone yeares, ſayth <hi>Pererius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would it were the worſt that might be ſaid
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:9226:95"/>
of this reaſon, to call it abſurd, friuolous, fooliſh. It is all that and more: euen derogatorie from God and his word: which by this meanes is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and thruſt out of doores, and cauſed to giue place to the follie and error of a ſillie man. For the ground of it is a decree from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, eſtabliſhing the authoritie of the olde Latin vulgar tranſlation, as the very au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall word of God, not to bee reiected or refuſed of any, vpon any pretence whatſoeuer. Hereof the Papiſts in their expoſitions alleadge that tranſlation, preferring it before the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall text it ſelfe receiued from heauen. And hereof it is that <hi>Pererius</hi> in his expoſition on this place, ſtandeth ſo much vpon the word <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breuiatae</hi> ſhortened: vrging it greatly for proof of his ſhort Moone yeares. It is a proofe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede from the bad interpretation of a man: not warrantable from the mouth of GOD: whoſe word in this place is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: which in the holie tongue ſignifieth properly to cut. In that ſence it is often vſed by the Hebrew writers thereof, calling a peece of a thing <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as <hi>Camius</hi> in the ſecond part of his Miclol, and <hi>Elias</hi> in his Tiſhbi teſtifie: where he declareth the true ſignification thereof by the Dutch and Italian tongues. Wherein the words to thoſe Hebrew anſwerable, are in Dutch, <hi>ein ſchint,</hi> or <hi>ein ſtuck:</hi> in Italian <hi>Pez,</hi> or <hi>talio,</hi> ſignifying any piece of a thing cut off. It is ſo alſo expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:9226:95"/>
by the Greeke interpreter: who here to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſignifying to cut.</p>
               <p>The meaning is, that ſo many yeares were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and decreed, by a ſpeech borrowed from things cut out: becauſe that in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and decreeing things, the reaſon of mans minde, ſundring trueth from falſhood, &amp; good from bad, doth by iudgement as it were cut out that which is conuenient and fit to bee done. Whereunto a like example in the ſame word is read in the Chaldie paraphraſis of <hi>Eſter</hi> the 4. chapter &amp; 5. verſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: which in Engliſh is thus much: And <hi>Eſter</hi> called for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Hathac,</hi> by the word of whoſe mouth the matters pertayning to the kingdome were cut out: that is, determined and appoynted. And in other wordes of the ſame ſignification wee haue like examples. In the ſecond chapter of Eſter the firſt verſe, King <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> remembred <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and that which was cut out vpon her: that is decreed and by iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t determined to come vpon her. Alſo in the firſt booke of the Kings, the 20. chapter and 40. verſe <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Hereby it is cleere that <hi>Pererius</hi> his reaſon being taken from mans interpretation, and not Gods worde, can bee no good ground for the Moone yeares to ſtand vpon. Let the Pope and twiſe ſo many Biſhops more, in their Councell ſet it vp as ſure as they can, God his word is more powerfull then they, to pull it downe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, though this were graunted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that the Latin edition by the Councels decree hath diuine authoritie, and therefore force ſufficient to proue the yeres of the moone to be vnderſtood in this place by the word <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breuiatae</hi> ſhortened: yet for all that, ſuch was the mans blindnes, euen thoſe his ſhort yeares are yet too ſhort to fill vp the want before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and to reach to the paſsion of Chriſt. For 490. yeares of the Moone make but 475. of the Sunne: which expire two full yeares at the leaſt before Chriſt dyed.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that <hi>Pererius</hi> would help out this matter by a diſtinction of <hi>incluſiuè,</hi> and <hi>excluſiuè</hi> computation. <hi>Jncluſiuè</hi> hee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth when the firſt and laſt are included in the number. <hi>Excluſiuè</hi> when they are left out; and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:9226:96"/>
thinketh that the whole number in all ſhould bee 490. Moone yeares or 477. of the Sunne, with the firſt and laſt included: and without them two onely 488. of the Moone and 475. of the Sunne betweene to be reckoned.</p>
               <p>This is a ridiculous ſhift. For the Prophet doth not namely ſpeake of 490. yeares or 477. (that is, gathered by interpreters, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome controuerſie among them) but of 70. weekes. So that if the extreames, firſt and laſt, were to bee excluded, they ſhould bee weekes, rather then yeares. Indeede if the Prophet had ſayd that there were 490. or 477. yeares, from the yeare of the commandement to the yeare of Chriſts death: it might peraduenture haue made ſome cauſe of wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gling about this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt and laſt yeares ſhould be excluded or no. But heere is no ſuch matter. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames here expreſſed, are the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to build Ieruſalem for one: and the other, as it is vnderſtood, the death of Chriſt. Now then, if the Prophet ſay, that from one of theſe extreames to the other, are 490. or 477. yeares excluſiuely: two dayes onely muſt bee exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, rather then two yeares. For the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement was giuen in a daye, and the death of Chriſt happened in a daye. It were ſtrange to make each of them of one whole yeares conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: and farre from that exact reckoning which <hi>Daniel</hi> maketh of his 70. weekes: firſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:9226:97"/>
ſeuen: then ſixtie and two: and laſt of all one.</p>
               <p>Therfore <hi>Julius Africanus,</hi> who as the chiefe author of theſe Moone yeares, is alleadged by <hi>Pererius,</hi> neuer once dreamed of any ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſiue computation. I muſt acknowledge that he taketh indeede this place to bee vnderſtood of 490. Moone yeares: which kinde of yeares the Hebrewes vſed, as he ſaith. But he could not ſtretch them any further then to the 16. yeare of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour of Rome: which is ſhort by two whole yeares of the time ſet by <hi>Pererius</hi> for the paſsion of our Lord, in the 18. yeare of Tiberius. And as they are ſhort of his paſsion: ſo they goe further then his baptiſme. For which cauſe that opinion of <hi>Africanus</hi> can no waye ſtande, making an ende of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes, neither in the birth, nor the baptiſme, nor the death of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Neither can that conceit of <hi>Africanus</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Moone yeares hereto be vnderſtood, by that reaſon which he bringeth for it, that is, by the cuſtome of the Hebrewes, be approued. Their moneths, I graunt, were in ſome ſort ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the courſe of the Moone. But the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their yeres was euer directed by the Sunne: and that as well before the captiuitie of Babylon, as after: as may by good arguments out of holie Scripture be proued.</p>
               <p>They were commaunded to celebrate their
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:9226:97"/>
feaſt of vnleauened bread, yearely from the 14. day of the firſt moneth to the 21. thereof, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to our Aprill in part (This was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe of the Moone.) And withall, to keepe it yearely in that ſeaſon of the yeare, wherein their barlie harueſt begun: as is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to bee ſeene in the 23. chapter of Leuit. the 10. verſe. <hi>When yee bee come into the lande which I giue vnto you, and reape the harueſt thereof: then ye ſhall bring a ſheafe of the firſt fruites of your harueſt vnto the Prieſt.</hi> Which could not bee but by the courſe of the Sunne. Likewiſe ſeuen weekes after that feaſt ended, was appoynted the celebration of Whitſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, at the end of their harueſt: which for that cauſe is named the Harueſt feaſt, and the feaſt of firſt fruits, whereof an offering was brought to the Lord, Exod. 23.16. Laſtly, their feaſt of Tabernacles euery yeare was kept in the 15. day of the 7. moneth: and withall in the ende of the yeare, after their vintage in Autumne, when all their grapes and other fruites of that ſeaſon were gathered, Exod. 23.16. Deut. 16. verſ. 13. It could not poſsiblie be, that the end of their harueſt ſhould be euery yere 7. weekes after Eaſter: and the end of their vintage, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the end of the yeare, alwayes from time to time in the 15. day of the 7. moneth, but by the yeare of the Sunne: whoſe courſe being fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed brought it to paſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:9226:98"/>Now that it ſeme not ſtrange which I haue brought concerning the Iewes harueſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Aprill, and ending ſeuen weekes after toward the ende of Maye, or not long after the beginning of Iune, becauſe in our countries it is much latter about Auguſt: we are to knowe that Iewrie being a hotter countrie, as nearer to the equinoctiall line, and the ſommer tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick then ours by 20. degrees, hath the harueſt by reaſon thereof much ſooner then with vs is accuſtomed, euen in their firſt month and the ſpring of the yeare. The Iſralites went ouer Iorden the 10. day of the firſt month, being the time of harueſt, &amp; foure daies before their paſſe-ouer. The diſciples of Chriſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 6. of <hi>Luke</hi> the firſt verſe,<note place="margin">Ioſ. 3.15. and 4.19. and 5.10.</note> a little after Eaſter walking through the corne plucked the eares of corne, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them in their handes and did eate them. VVhich argued the ripeneſſe of corne at that ſeaſon. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 18. booke and 18. chapter, ſpeaking of the Egiptians, which are neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iudea; telleth that they goe into their fieldes with the ſicle a little before Aprill, and finiſh their harueſt in May.</p>
               <p>Theſe feaſtes then euery yeare falling to the time of harueſt, bring manifeſt proofe for the yeare of the Hebrewes, that it was ordained by the courſe of the Sunne. The time of the children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> eating Manna, in ſcripture is accompted 40. yeares: in the end of the 16.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:9226:98"/>
chapter of Exodus, reckoned from their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of Egypt, Nombres the 33. chapter the 38. verſ. Which number from the ſame ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the yeare to the ſame, by the yeares of the ſunne is moſt exact. For they came forth of Egipt the 15. day of the firſt month, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of barly harueſt. And the very ſame day of the ſame month, in barly harueſt their Manna ceaſed. Ioſ. 5.12. In the 25. chapter of Leuiticus, the Iſralites are commaunded to ſow their feeld, and cut their vineyardes, and gather the fruites thereof 6. yeares: and to let the 7. reſt as a ſabbath yeare to the Lord. And 7. of thoſe ſabbaths are accompted 49. yeares, at the end whereof in the 10. day of the 7. month began the Iubelie. Theſe yeares moſt manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were yeares of the ſunne. Otherwiſe all the fruites of thoſe yeares could not haue been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in harueſt and vintage, as God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For 49. yeares of the moone would verie neere haue cut off one and a halfe, the laſt expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in winter before anie corne or other fruite were redie to be gathered therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniell</hi> himſelfe toward the beginning of this chapter, made mention of the 70. yeares of captiuitie. VVhere no one, that euer I heard of, vnderſtood other yeares then of the ſunne. It were a ſtrange thing, if in one chapter firſt ſpeaking of 70. yeares, and after of 70. weekes of yeares, he ſhould vnderſtand diuers ſortes of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:9226:99"/>
yeares one of the ſunne, and an other of the moone. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 15. booke <hi>de ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei</hi> the 14. chapter, diſputing againſt the opinion of ſome, who were perſwaded that the yeares of the ancient fathers, which liued in the firſt age, were not of the Sunne: vſeth theſe wordes: <hi>Tantus tunc dies fuit, quantus &amp; nunc eſt. Tantus tunc me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſis, quantus &amp; nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c eſt: quem luna caepta &amp; finita concluſit. Tantus annus, quantus &amp; nunc eſt, quem</hi> 12. <hi>menſes lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nares, additis propter curſum ſolis</hi> 5. <hi>diebus &amp; quadrante, conſummant.</hi> The daye was as great then (ſayth <hi>Augustine</hi>) as it is now. The moneth as great then as now, contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of the Moones courſe from the beginning to the end. The yeare was then as great as now, perfected by twelue moneths of the Moone, with fiue dayes and a quarter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Twelue moneths of the Moone with fiue dayes and a quatter more, make vp the Sunnes yeare, the ſame which wee now vſe at this day. For euery moneth in old time, by <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgement, contained iuſt thirtie dayes: as is to bee ſeene in his fourth booke <hi>De Trinitate</hi> the fourth chapter, where he writeth thus: <hi>Si</hi> 12. <hi>menſes integri conſiderentur, quos triceni dies complent, talem quippe menſem veteres ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruauerunt quem circuitus lunaris ostendit.</hi> That is, if the twelue moneths whole bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered which containe thirtie dayes a peece.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:9226:99"/>
Such was the moneth by men of olde time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which the courſe of the moone ſhewed. This is manifeſt by the hiſtorie of <hi>Noes</hi> floud in the ſeuen and eight chapters of Geneſis, where we are taught that the floud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the ſeuenteenth day of the ſecond moneth: and the Arke reſted on a mountaine of Ararat in the ſeuenteenth day of the ſeuenth moneth. Which ſpace there by Gods holy ſpirit is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 150. dayes: which reckoning giueth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery moneth thirtie daies a peece, neither more nor leſſe.</p>
               <p>I might bring other teſtimonies to confirme this cuſtome of the Hebrewes yere, ordered by the compaſſe of the Sunnes mouing, if it were needfull: but I hope that which hath been ſayd alreadie, is ſufficient to improoue the firſt ſhift of <hi>Africanus</hi> and other, deuiſed by 490. ſhort Moone yeres to cut ſhort the time of <hi>Daniels</hi> propheſie by 13. yeares: that is, two whole weekes of the 70. within a yeare. Seeing that they can neither ſerue to fill vp the diſtance from <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his 20. yeare, to the ſuffering of Chriſt, for which they are brought, nor yet the cuſtome of the Hebrewes reckoning in holie Scripture will beare them.</p>
               <p>The other ſhift is as bad and ſillie as that, if not more. For ſome who could not abide that forced wreſting of Moone yeares, where there is no likelihood of ſuch to be ment, went ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:9226:100"/>
way to worke, making two beginnings, and thence two twentieth yeres of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his raigne. One beginning was immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of his father <hi>Xerxes</hi> in the 4. yeare of the 78. Olympiad. The other nine yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the 4. of the 76. Olympiad: wherein he was appoynted king by his father yet liuing, nine yeares before his death: from which the 20. is the 3. of the 81. Olympiad for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes, ſayth <hi>Gerardus Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator.</hi> Wherein notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he was greatly deceiued, by what error I know not. For recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the third of the 81. Olympiad, to the laſt of the 202. wherein Chriſt dyed: wee ſhall finde no more but 486. yeares at the moſt. And therefore I ſee not by what reaſon he ſayth, that the 70. weekes contayning 490. yeares, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at that twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> expired in the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Temporarius</hi> therefore making two begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and two 20. yeares of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as he doth, accounteth from the firſt twentieth 483. yeares to Chriſt his baptiſme; which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue three yeares before his paſsion, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the death of Chriſt, three yeares and more before the end of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes. But what reaſon had <hi>Mercator</hi> and <hi>Temporarius</hi> to thinke, that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> begun to raigne whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt his father was yet aliue, ſo long before his death? This is a matter worth the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:9226:100"/>
being the ground of a great errour. The reaſon which they bring is in this manner. <hi>Themistocles</hi> the Athenian in the ſecond yere of the 77. Olympiad, being expelled out of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens by his vnthankfull countrie men and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, notwithſtanding the great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deliuerance of all Greece from the power of <hi>Xerxes</hi> king of Perſia, by his wiſedome and proweſſe eſpecially wrought: fled to the ſame <hi>Xerxes;</hi> as <hi>Ephorus, Deino, Cleitarchus, Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides, Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and other ſtorie wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters declare.</p>

I haue heard it reported of one Doctor <hi>Medcalfe,</hi> who ſometime was maſter of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge in Cambridge, a man of no great learning himſelfe: but for care and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt endeuour euery way to aduance learning, giuing place to none. Whereby it maye bee thought that that famous Colledge hath by his meanes the better proſpered and flouriſhed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince, with ſo great a companie of excellent Diuines and skilfull men in other knowledge. I haue (I ſay) heard it reported of him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing on a certain day at ſupper with him ſome of the chiefe Seniors of the Colledge, hee ſent for two Sophiſters to diſpute before them. The one tooke vpon him to proue that his fellowes blacke gowne was greene; requiring this only firſt to be granted vnto him, that if there were any greene gowne in that chamber, it was on his backe. Which was not thought vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: becauſe it was euident, that there was none elſe had any. This then being once gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he framed the reſt of his proofe in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. That (ſaith he) poynting to a greene carpet on the table, there is a greene in this chamber all our eyes witneſſe: and that there is gowne in it, your owne vpper garment on your backes proueth: whereof it followeth, that here amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs in this chamber there is a greene gowne. Doctor <hi>Medcalfe</hi> hearing this was greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and affirmed in good ſadneſſe that it
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:9226:101"/>
was a good reaſon: &amp; withall asked the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Seniors there preſent: who ſmiling, commended the ſchollers wit.</p>
               <p>Such a ſophiſtication is here brought, by ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things together which ought to bee ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. For neither they which tell of <hi>Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> flying to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> once euer dreamed of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> raigning at the ſame time: nor <hi>Thucidides</hi> ſpeaking of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes,</hi> had this in his mind to think that <hi>Xerxes</hi> ſhould bee then aliue: which I will prooue by good witneſſe. For <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi> writeth thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Thucidides,</hi> ſaith <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> and <hi>Charon Lampſacenus</hi> tell that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Xerxes</hi> was dead, <hi>Themistocles</hi> came to his ſonne. <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> confirmeth it in theſe wordes: <hi>Scio plaeróſque ita ſcripſiſſe, Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clem Xerxe regnante in Aſiam tranſiiſſe: ſed ego potiſſimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Thucididi credo, quòd aetate proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus crat.</hi> I know, ſaith <hi>Probus,</hi> that many wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters report, <hi>Themistocles</hi> to haue paſſed into Aſia whileſt <hi>Xerxes</hi> was yet aliue: but I rather beleeue <hi>Thucidides,</hi> who was neere thoſe times. Laſtly, <hi>Lawrence Codoman</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of his Chronologie, is as plaine for it as may be. That (ſayth he) which <hi>Thucidides</hi> teſtifieth in his firſt booke, that <hi>Themistocles</hi> fled to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> of late hauing begun to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:9226:102"/>
raigne: muſt bee vnderſtoode of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> begun after his fathers death.</p>
               <p>There was ſome difference betweene them I grant, in regard of the perſons to whom, and the time when <hi>Themistocles</hi> came: ſome thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to bee done when <hi>Xerxes</hi> was king, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the raigne of his ſonne. Other, when <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> raigned after the death of his father. But all agreed in this, that at ſuch time as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi> fled out of Greece, there was not two, but only one king of Perſia: which is moſt certainly true.</p>
               <p>Let the record of all hiſtories bee ſought, for the whole time of the Perſian Monarchie from the beginning to the ende: it ſhall neuer bee found that the father and his ſonne raigned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Herodotus</hi> indeed in Polymnia, not far from the beginning, telleth of a cuſtome and lawe of the Perſians, that their king going to warre, firſt appoynted an heire who was to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede him in the Empire. And that <hi>Xerxes</hi> was ſo appoynted by his father <hi>Darius,</hi> hauing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all things readie for his voyage agaynſt Aegypt, to be next king after him. Yet he neuer raigned till his father was dead. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: when <hi>Darius</hi> was dead, ſayth <hi>Herodotus,</hi> the kingdome came to his ſonne <hi>Xerxes.</hi> So that if <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as they ſay, were appoynted king by his father <hi>Xerxes</hi> in his life time, it was
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:9226:102"/>
but for the next place after his fathers death, to be an heire apparant and ſucceſſor. Farre from that imperiall maieſtie which <hi>Thucidides</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to him, calling him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a king newly come to his kingdome.</p>
               <p>But for my part, weighing all circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances, I ſee not any colour that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſhould be choſen ſo much as heire apparant by his father yet liuing: much leſſe king. He had three ſons by his chiefe wife Queene <hi>Amestris:</hi> firſt of all <hi>Darius:</hi> then two yeares after another cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hystaſpes:</hi> and laſt of all this <hi>Artaxerxes:</hi> beſides two daughters, as <hi>Cteſias</hi> declareth. By the cuſtome of the Perſians it muſt needes bee, that he named his next heire and ſucceſſor to the crowne, before his famous voyage into Greece. And who was then to be named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Darius?</hi> For <hi>Gerardus Mercator</hi> in his Chronology maketh it a thing paſt doubt, that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was at that time vnborne. Whereunto agreeth that which wee reade in <hi>Iustin,</hi> in the beginning of his third booke concerning the age of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> at his fathers death: which happened about 16. yeares after his going foorth agaynſt Greece. For there by <hi>Iustin</hi> he is termed <hi>admodum pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> a very child. If he had then been borne: yet there is no likelihood that he ſhould haue been preferred either before <hi>Darius</hi> the eldeſt of all; or the next, that is <hi>Hystaſpes,</hi> being elder then
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:9226:103"/>
he. This deuiſe therefore of two beginnings and two 20. yeares of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to helpe out the want of ſo many yeares betwixt the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> and the death of Chriſt, is a very poore ſhift and altogether fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous.</p>

            <div n="200-257" type="pages">
               <p>If plaine proofe had been brought by the teſtimonie of ancient writers, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and monarchie of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> begun whileſt his father liued, and that they raigned both at once many yeares together; they had ſayd ſomewhat to the purpoſe. But that is not done: It is fetched about I know not how, by vaine coniectures, and geſsing, and childiſh wrangling and ſophiſtrie.

               <p>That therefore which <hi>Iulius Africanus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his Chronologie the 5. booke, that if we begin to number <hi>Daniels</hi> 70. weekes from any other beginning then the 20. of <hi>Artaxerxes:</hi>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:9226:103"/>
the Perſian kinges to build Ieruſalem; or how the word Meſſias in this place can bee applied to our Sauiour Ieſus, euen by their owne expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, for if the 70. weekes expire in the death of Chriſt, as <hi>Beroaldus</hi> with the moſt part and beſt learned thinke, why doeth <hi>Daniel</hi> reckon onely threeſcore and nine to Meſſias, except they will ſay that Meſſias is here taken for the ſeauenth yeare before the death of Meſſias, which were a ſtrange kinde of interpretation. And as Chronologie here fitteth not for Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to be vnderſtood of Chriſt our Lord: ſo the verie text it ſelfe is againſt it, which maketh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſeuen weekes, that is 49. yeres diſtance from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement to Meſſias in plaine ſpeech; ſo that it cannot bee applied to our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour without ſtrayning and wreſting, which they who ſo vnderſtand it of Chriſt Ieſus are driuen vnto. They are faine to vſe chopping and changing, adding and taking away, contrarie to the expreſſe commandement of God: For firſt, whereas the original text after theſe words ſeauen weekes hath a reſt, yea that reſt which is vſuall in the middeſt of a ſentence, to ſignifie a pauſe after halfe the verſe now alreadie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: this pauſe by them is taken away, and the wordes without anie reſt at all continued with the next following, and the pauſe or ſtay made at 62. weekes in this manner: <hi>From the out go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word to build againe Ieruſalem vnto
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:9226:104"/>
Meſſias the gouernour, ſhalbe ſeauen weekes, &amp; 62. weekes.</hi> Againe becauſe in that interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs, the wordes, and 62. weekes are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the other following, wherewith they ſhould be ioyned, as in my interpretation before deliuered may appere, &amp; by that meanes the ſence ſo darkned, that of it ſelfe in any plaine conſtruction of ſence it cannot ſtand: To make ſomewhat of it they are faine to thruſte in words of their own inuention, as for that which God ſayeth, it ſhall bee builded againe, they ſay, &amp; it ſhal be builded againe, thruſting in the coniunction more than ought to bee. Some put in other wordes, ſome change verbes into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiples, and all to make 483. yeares diſtance betwixt the decree and the Meſſias heere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, in ſteed of onlie 49.</p>
               <p>Here is great ods, what is this els but to make Gods word a wax noſe to turne which waie a man liſt at his pleaſure? How is it poſſible that by ſuch kind of dealing diuine ſcripture ſhould be rightly vnderſtood? Howe ſhall the Iewes by ſuch wreſting of texts, bee made Chriſtians and brought to beleeue that Chriſt is come? Here it may bee, ſome will ſay vnto mee, you make more a doe about diſtinctions &amp; pauſes and pointes then is need: thoſe are ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and not ſo ſtreightlie and preciſelie to be looked into. I may giue men leaue to thinke as they liſt: but the truth is, that euen theſe ſmall
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:9226:104"/>
matters of diſtinctions and reſts, are of great weight &amp; importance to the true vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God his holie word: yet bee it graunted, that as ſmall matters they may bee neglected. Is that alſo a ſmall matter to put in wordes of their owne, which the cuſtome of the originall tongue will not beare? Well let that bee yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, be it a trifle not to bee ſtood vppon.</p>
               <p>Though all this were graunted, and though there were no vowels nor points at all, yet euen the verie manner of the ſpeech it ſelfe were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reproue their interpretation: for who euer read in the Hebrew Bible this kinde of ſpeech; Seuen and threeſcore, and two for three<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcore and nine? It is not the cuſtome of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt to ſpeake after that manner. If all the Hebrew ſcripture from the beginning of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, to the end of <hi>Malachie</hi> be ſought through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, no one cleare example of the like can bee found.</p>
               <p>As for that which <hi>Pererius</hi> bringeth from the twelfth verſe of the 45. chapter of <hi>Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell: Tremellius</hi> will ſoone teach him, that it is in another kinde.</p>
               <p>If therefore neither agreement of time, nor text of holy ſcripture permit the name Meſſias in this place to be referred to Ieſus Chriſt: we are to examine what other ſignification of this word is more agreeable to both. It is vſed ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of our Sauiour Chriſt, and ſometimes
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:9226:105"/>
more generally take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as before is ſhewed, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny annoynted Prieſt, Prophet, Prince, or chiefe Gouernour of the common wealth, and this is the ſignification, which in my iudgement beſt fitteth this place. And of Chriſtian interpreters <hi>Euſebius</hi> is the man, which hath either taught me it, or guided me to it, or confirmed mee in it: who in his eight booke <hi>de demonstratione Euangelica</hi> hauing brought the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus,</hi> vnderſtanding here Chriſt Ieſus by the name of Meſſias or Chriſt, addeth theſe wordes. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is; I ſay that the Gouernour Chriſt here ſpoken of in this text of ſcripture, by an other ſignification or acception is no other but a ſucceſſion of high Prieſts, which after this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and the Iewes returne from Babilon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the people, which the ſcripture vſuallie calleth Chriſts or annoynteds.</p>
               <p>In this number hee reckoneth <hi>Iudas Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeus</hi> and his brethren, and their poſteritie, who exerciſed a kingly gouernment ouer the Iewes, and a little after expounding theſe words in the 26. verſe. <hi>Chriſt ſhall be cut off:</hi> who (ſaith he) is this Chriſt, but the gouernour which by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Prieſts kindred ruled the people? This Chriſt therfore endured all the time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:9226:105"/>
theſe weekes were to bee fulfilled: but ſo ſoone as they once were ended according to this propheſie, the chiefe ruler of the people of that ſucceeding kindred was cut off, ſaith <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a notable ſaying of <hi>Euſebius</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the true meaning of the worde Meſſias; which may direct vs to vnderſtand this moſt excellent propheſie aright, <hi>Theodoretus</hi> herein agreeth vnto him.</p>
               <p>I take it ſomewhat more largely then <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and <hi>Theodoretus</hi> doeth, not of the Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies onely, but of other chiefe rulers and kings of the Iewes common wealth, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of theſe weekes, as the Hebrew ſcholiaſts <hi>Saadias, Aben, Ezra, Iarchi,</hi> and ſome other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it. Not one Hebrew writer that euer I read, vndeſtood their Meſſias by this worde, but a ſucceſſion of annoynted, eyther Prieſtes, or Gouernours.</p>
               <p>The decree to build Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I take to be that which was made by <hi>Darius</hi> for the building of the temple, which was the chiefeſt parte of the citie. In the ſecond yeare of that <hi>Darius,</hi> and the 6. month the firſt day toward the end of our Auguſt, they were commaunded in the Lordes name by his prophet <hi>Aggie,</hi> to build the holy temple of Ieruſalem: as wee read in the firſt chapter and firſt verſe of the prophet. After they had begun to build, the gouernours of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:9226:106"/>
countries beyond Euphrates came vnto them to know by whoſe authoritie they tooke that worke vpon them,<note place="margin">Ezra chap. 5. and 6.</note> who anſwered that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had giuen them leaue to doe it long before in the firſt yeare of his raigne. Of this anſwere they certified king <hi>Darius.</hi> By whoſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſearch was made: firſt in the recordes at Babylon: after at Ecbataua the chiefe citie of Medes, where a record touching that matter was found. Herevpon <hi>Darius</hi> made a new decree for building thereof; and ſent it to the gouernours of his countries beyond Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, charging them to permitte and helpe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the building thereof.</p>
               <p>All theſe thinges were not done in a little time, from the prophets ſending by God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that matter, to the time wherein <hi>Darius</hi> ſent his decree. It asked ſome time to beginne the worke after the prophets warning. And then for the gouernours in other prouinces to be certified. And after themſelues to come and examine the matter. At what time it is ſayd that they found the worke in good forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the beames being layde in the walles. <hi>Ezra</hi> the 5 chapter 8. verſe: and after to certifie <hi>Darius:</hi> and then to ſearch the recordes, and that in thoſe farre places of Babylon and Ecba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taua. And laſtly to ſend forth the new decree.</p>
               <p>So farre as we may geſſe, this time might be about ſome 8. or 9. monthes, and bring vs to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:9226:106"/>
the month of Aprill or Maie in the 3. yeare of <hi>Darius.</hi> And who was this <hi>Darius?</hi> In my iudgement no other but the <hi>ſurnamed Nothus,</hi> who was ſonne to <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus.</hi> This <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (as <hi>Thucidides</hi> then liuing teſtifieth) died in the 7. yeare of the Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian warre in winter which was the 4. of the 88. Olympiad. After him <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Sogdia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> raigned 1. yeare. And after them this <hi>Darius</hi> whoſe 3. yeare at that ſeaſon wherein the decree to build the temple went out, falleth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the 3. yeare of the 89. Olymp.</p>
               <p>For the publiſhing of that decree to Meſſias, that is the firſt gouernour of the new builded citie, are accompted here by <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. weekes, contayning 49. yeares. VVhereof 17. pertained to <hi>Darius</hi> after the decree: for he raigned 19. in all. The other 32. were of <hi>Artaxerxes Mne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> his ſucceſſor. In whoſe 20. yeare <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias</hi> was ſent to build the walles of Ieruſalem, and 12. yeares after, the building of the walles being finiſhed and the Meſſias or gouernour appointed, and the common wealth euery way ſet in order: hee returned to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the 32. yeare of his raigne.</p>
               <p>The proofe hereof is cleere by ſcripture. In the 5. chapter of <hi>Nehemias</hi> the 14. verſe. From the time ſayth <hi>Nehemias,</hi> that the king com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded me to be gouernour in the land of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, from the 20. to the 32. yeare of king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:9226:107"/>
that is 12. yeares: I and my brethren haue not eaten the bread of the gouernour. For the gouernours before mee had beene charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the people, and ſo forth. Alſo in the 13. chapter of the ſame booke the ſixt verſe. All this while (ſaith he) was not I at Ieruſalem, for in the 32. yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> king of Babell I returned to the king.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger</hi> in his ſixt booke <hi>de emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione temporum,</hi> giueth his voice with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, affirming that <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> was the king vnder whome the decree was made to build the Citie, and that from it to the ſtreetes and walles of Ieruſalem finiſhed, were nine &amp; fortie yeares. After which time, <hi>Nehemias di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectis platais vrbis &amp; vicis exaedificatis, atque omnibus rebus compoſitis reuerſus eſt in Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem anno Artaxerxis altero &amp; triceſimo. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemias</hi> (ſaith <hi>Scaliger</hi>) ſo ſoone as the ſtreets of the citie were directed, and the lanes builded, &amp; all thinges ſet in order, returned into Perſia in the two and thirtieth yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is here to be obſerued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Meſſias, and the building vp of the Citie, as beginning both at one time: For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing foretold that there ſhould bee to Meſſias ſeauen weekes: it followeth immediatly after how long the Citie was to continue. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof is this, that there could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently any Princely gouernment of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:9226:107"/>
wealth before the building of the Citie, wherein the Princes Court and Pallace ſhould be: which Pallace for the Prince was builded by <hi>Nehemias</hi> alſo, as appeareth in the ſecond of <hi>Nehemias,</hi> verſe eight. Hereof it is that <hi>Sanbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat</hi> in a letter to <hi>Nehemias,</hi> ioyneth theſe two together: the building of the walles, and a king ſet ouer the Iewes. It is reported (ſaith <hi>Sanbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat</hi>) among the heathen, that thou &amp; the Iewes thinke to rebell: for which cauſe thou buildeſt the wall that thou mayeſt bee their king accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their wordes. Thou haſt alſo ordained Prophets to preach of thee in Ieruſalem, ſaying there is a king in Iuda.</p>
               <p>Theſe two thinges then begun together, the Citie builded, and the annoynted Gouernour thereof, as alſo the end of both was at one time, declared in the 26. verſe.

               <p>Thus whereas <hi>Daniel</hi> hath deuided his 70. weekes into three parts: The firſt of them hath his true meaning by text and time appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, from the decree to build Ieruſalem, to the ſame building finiſhed, and the eſtabliſhed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in it, beeing the ſpace of 49. yeares: The ſecond part containeth 62. weekes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Ieruſalem ſo builded with the common wealth, and ſtate, and princely gouernment
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:9226:108"/>
thereof was to continue, that is to ſay, from the building of the Citie finiſhed, and the Prince or ruler appointed in the 32. of <hi>Artaxerxes Mne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> vnto ſuch time as the ruine and fall of the ſame Citie began, which was about the nine yeare of <hi>Nero:</hi> For about that time <hi>Albinus</hi> the Roman Gouernour of Iudea &amp; Ieruſalem, by his great couetouſnes and crueltie in moſt wofull manner oppreſſed the Iewes, for bribes, euen ſelling them to be ſpoyled and robbed of their goods, at the will and pleaſure of moſt lewd ruffins and bad perſons. As <hi>Joſephus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth in his ſecond booke of the Iewes warre the thirteenth Chapter, inferring thereof that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. the ſeedes of Ieruſalems captiuitie approching, was from that time ſowne, meaning that thoſe troubles vnder <hi>Albinus</hi> were the beginnings of the Iewes thraldome and vndoing, as indeede they were, which in the twentieth booke of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities the eight chapter, hee declareth more plainely: where hauing ſpoken of the great miſerie of the Iewes, which they ſuffered by the mercileſſe crueltie of <hi>Albinus,</hi> hee vſeth theſe wordes. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. From that time forward ſaith <hi>Ioſphus,</hi> eſpecially our Citie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſicke, and all things going then more and more to decay. The wofull calamities of Ieruſalem euery day falling more and more to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:9226:108"/>
wracke after the gouernment of <hi>Albinus,</hi> by a borrowed ſpeech hee termeth ſicknes.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of that yeare, at the feaſt of the Tabernacle it was, that a certaine man of the common ſort brought vp in the countrie, called Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Anani,</hi> as a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by diuine motion from God, to foreſhew the vtter ruine and deſolation of Ieruſalem to come in that laſt weeke of the 70. which was yet behinde, in the ſtreetes of the Citie cryed day and night; a voice from the Eaſt, a voice from the Weſt, a voice from the foure windes, a voice againſt Ieruſalem and the Temple, a voice againſt Bridegroomes and Brides, a voice againſt all the people. The Magiſtrates and Nobles of the Citie not abiding his outcries brought him before <hi>Albinus:</hi> who cauſed him with ſcourges to bee torne to the bones, when the ſillie wretch neyther wept nor craued anie mercie, but at euery ſtroke anſwered woe, woe, to Ieruſalem. In this manner crying hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſeuen yeres &amp; more without anie hoarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or wearines: neyther curſing them that hurt him, nor thanking them that releeued him. At the length going on the walles with this crie woe, woe, to the Citie, and the Temple, &amp; the people, hee added theſe wordes, woe alſo to my ſelfe, and was preſently ſlaine with a ſtone hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by an Engine at him from the enemie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeging the Citie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:9226:109"/>Thus the ſecond part of this Propheſie, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewing how long the Iewes common wealth after the ordering thereof ſhould continue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it began to decay, contained 62. weekes, that is, 434. yeares: for the 32. of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon</hi> was the fourth yeare of the 101. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad, towards the end wherof the building of Ieruſalem was finiſhed, and the Iewes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth appointed, and the firſt yere of the laſt weeke, was the ſecond yeare of the 210. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad, beginning toward the end of it in the ſpring time of the yeare. The ſpace included containeth the full number before declared.</p>
               <p>The third &amp; laſt part is one weeke, euen the laſt of all the 70. wherein after the former 62. weekes expired, Meſſias, that is the laſt Ruler was cut off, and the gouernement of the Citie quite extinct, for when their laſt king <hi>Agrippa</hi> in the twelfth yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> foure yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deſtruction of the Citie, went about to perſwade the people to obey <hi>Florus</hi> the Roman deputie, by whoſe tyrannie they had beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more vexed and oppreſſed, then in the time of <hi>Albinus</hi> his predeceſſor: The people were ſo ſtirred againſt him, that they could not containe themſelues any longer, but threw ſtones at him, and droue him out of the Citie, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> declareth in the ſixteene chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſecond booke of the Iewes war.</p>
               <p>If any here obiect, that <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:9226:109"/>
of Rome after the death of this <hi>Agrippas</hi> father, made Iudea a prouince to bee gouerned by a Roman Deputie, and beſtowed on this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> the kingdome of Chalcis, which pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his vncle <hi>Herod;</hi> I anſwer that this <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> had his kingly Pallace in Ieruſalem, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of <hi>C.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Tyrranie or vſurped go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment was exerciſed by manie. This begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of miſrule by little and little grew to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe, till at the length the king was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out, and not long after al other magiſtracy of Ieruſalem was likewiſe aboliſhed, all good gouernment ceaſed, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in plaine words
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:9226:110"/>
declareth in the fourth booke and fift chapter of the Iewes warre, that the citie was without a ruler to guide it. And in the ſecond chapter of the fift booke: that all law of man was troden vnder foot, and the law of God made a ſcorne, and the lawes of nature it ſelfe diſturbed. All things were ordered by the will of lawleſſe ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, their pleaſure ſtood for law. A moſt piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſorder and tumultuous anarchie raigned amongſt them by the wilfull malice of grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe rebels, appoynting iudges of their owne choyce for their turne, and creating hie prieſts whom they liſt, vile and vnworthie men: and thoſe of ſuch tribes, as by Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were forbidden that holie ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Thus was it fulfilled and verified which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> here foretold of Meſſias, to bee cut off after 62. weekes in the laſt of the 70. Whereunto he alſo addeth this more; that in the ſame weeke the citie and Temple ſhould bee deſtroyed by the come gouernours people: meaning the Romane armie which waſted Ieruſalem and Iudea by the ſpace of foure yeres together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, from the 12. yeare of <hi>Nero</hi> to the end of the warre. Firſt, <hi>Florus</hi> the Romane depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie begun by his intollerable couetouſnes and merciles oppreſſion, turning the peoples hearts againſt him to complaine of their wrongs by him ſuſtained. Which ſo ſtirred him, that forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee ſought a new quarrell of greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:9226:110"/>
and ſent vnto Ieruſalem for 17. talents of ſiluer to be giuen him forth of the holie trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie. Which being denied, he made no more adoe, but came againſt Ieruſalem with an hoſt of horſemen and footmen, by force and armes to obtaine his wil, and reuenge himſelfe of ſuch as had ſpoken againſt him. Being entred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the citie into the Deputies pallace, he cryed to his ſouldiers, commaunding them to ſpoyle the citie and ſlay whomſoeuer they met.</p>
               <p>Thus Ieruſalem was giuen for a prey, and the inhabitants ſlaine, man, woman and childe, to the number of 630. and many of the Nobles whipped and torne with ſcourges and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And not herewith content, a little after he ſent for new ſouldiers, who once againe kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the poore Iewes in peaceable manner, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth of their citie to meete and receiue them with a friendly welcome. Some were beaten downe with clubs, ſome troden vnder the horſes feete, ſome choked in the great preaſe at the gates, many ſlaine with the ſword. And after that, by the ſame <hi>Florus,</hi> was a new ſlaughter made of the Iewes in Caeſarea. After all theſe troubles, <hi>Florus</hi> not yet contented, made a great complaint of the Iewes to <hi>Ceſtius</hi> the gouernour of Syria: who for that cauſe brought a great armie againſt Iudea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed many townes and villages therein, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſpoyle thereof to his ſouldiers. At the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:9226:111"/>
laſt he brought his armie in battel aray into Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and burned diuers ſtreets thereof, and made hauocke of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Lords inheritance conſumed and deſtroyed by the cruell Romanes, til at the length <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> ſent by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Nero,</hi> waſted all the whole lande, and brought vtter deſolation vpon the Temple and citie, both burnt with fire: thereby fulfilling <hi>Daniels</hi> propheſie, and making an ende of his 70. weekes, being yeares 490. From the third of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> wherein the decree went out to build Ieruſalem, to the ouerthrow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that was the third of the 89. Olympiad, this the firſt of the 112. both almoſt expired: the ſpace betweene is 490. yeares.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this crueltie and hot warre of the Romanes againſt the Iewes, diuers of the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and generals in moſt friendly manner were content to make couenants of peace with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Iewes: who being quietly minded in fauour to the Romanes, and deteſting the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and lewd doings of the ſeditious rebels, ſought their friendſhip. <hi>Cestius Gallus</hi> in the beginning of that warre, offered a league of friendſhip to the citizens of Ieruſalem: which many (leauing that rebellious rout) embraced, and fled out of the citie vnto him. Likewiſe, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> diuers and ſundrie times receiued many into their friendſhip comming
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:9226:111"/>
vnto them, and moſt louingly offered a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full league of ſure peace to anie whoſoeuer were deſirous of it, in loue and good meaning to the Romane gouernment, and hatred of the rebels. Of which ſort deſiring peace, and parties of that league, was a great number not only in Ieruſalem, but diuers other places.</p>
               <p>All this is faithfully recorded by <hi>Joſephus</hi> an eye-witneſſe of thoſe times: <hi>Dauiſons</hi> hiſtorie alſo confirming the ſame. And this it is which the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſeemeth to meane, where he ſpeaketh of a couenant to be eſtabliſhed to many one weeke: as ſome expoſitors haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it, and namely <hi>R. Salomon,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Iarchi, Rabbi Leui</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Gerſhom, Aben Ezra,</hi> and <hi>R. Abraham</hi> in his Cabbala. But for my owne part, I thinke rather that it is to bee referred to the new couenant of the Goſpell of Chriſt, by the preaching whereof in this laſt weeke, the beleeuing Iewes were eſpeciallie at that time aboue al other, when ſo great miſerie of woful deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was now at hand, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed more and more in the true faith. And many alſo thereby then called and wonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new vnto it, whom it pleaſed the Lord of life by offering that gratious league of ſaluation vnto them, not only to rid from thoſe (horrible indeede, yet temporall) troubles approching; but alſo to ſaue euerlaſtingly. For there was (no doubt) at that time a great companie of holie
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:9226:112"/>
Saints in Ieruſalem and Iewrie which beleeued in Chriſt: of whoſe deliuerance at that time the Lord had eſpeciall care.</p>
               <p>Although this is a thing not to bee doubted of: yet by the prouidence of God, that thereby his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ouer his church may be knowne; wee haue a notable record thereof in <hi>Euſebius</hi> the third booke of his Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie the fift chapter. The Church (ſayth <hi>Euſebius</hi>) which was gathered together at Ieruſalem, was commanded by an oracle from God to flit out of it to a certaine towne beyond Iorden called Pella: to the entent that thoſe good and holie men being taken out of the citie, place thereby might be giuen to the vengeance of GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it and the wicked Iewes, by the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ouerthrow thereof.</p>
               <p>If any here aske who there is before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to whom theſe words, <hi>he ſhall make a ſure couenant,</hi> may be referred but the Romane ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. I anſwere, that it is no new thing in the Hebrew tongue for the perſon of the doer to bee vnderſtood, though not expreſſely ſpoken of before: when the tranſitiue verbe hath an imperſonall notion. A hundred ſuch examples might be brought, ſome out of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome out of the new, ſome out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane authors, which I will not ſtand vpon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing well knowne and taught, euen in the Grammer rules of the holie tongue. The
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:9226:112"/>
meaning is, that before the vtter deſtruction of Ieruſalem, a holie and ſure couenant ſhould be made vnto the faithfull number of the Iewes, choſen to ſaluation by ſuch miniſters and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments as it ſhould pleaſe God to vſe for that worke in that laſt weeke of Ieruſalem: in the one halfe or middeſt whereof the ſacrifices appoynted in the law of God and accuſtomed, begun to be neglected and ceaſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt they reiected al ſacrifices and oblations for any ſtranger which was not a Iew, being before vſually from time to time wont to bee offered. And a little after in the 13. yere of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> when <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was come into Iudea and waſted the countrie: then the vnrulie rebels in Ieruſalem aboliſhed the lawfull cuſtome of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, appoynting prieſts of the common people and countrie clownes, a thing forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by Gods lawe. They held the Temple and holie places, keeping themſelues therein as a caſtle of defence: and at the length partly by the ſedition within, and partly ſharpe warre without, it came to paſſe that the prieſts in time of their ſacrificing were ſlaine by darts and ſtones hurled from the rebels: and in the ende for want of men there was no daily obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any more offered. This <hi>Ioſephus</hi> declareth in the 2. booke the 17. chapter, the 4. booke the 5. chapter, the 5. booke the 9. chapter, the 6. booke the firſt and fourth chapters, the ſeuenth

booke the fourth chapter of the Iewes warre. Wherfore not without cauſe in my iudgement may thoſe words of <hi>Daniel,</hi> touching the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ceaſing in the middeſt of the laſt weeke, bee referred vnto theſe times of this warre: wherein by meanes thereof the ſacrifices of the Lords houſe were hindered ſo many wayes: ſome were quite aboliſhed, and others done either not by thoſe to whom they pertained: or not ſo ſafely and freely as they ought. Yea I ſee not how any at all many dayes could bee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by reaſon of the ſeditious hurlie burlies in the citie, and the warre without, the ſacrificers themſelues oftentimes being ſlaine or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the middeſt of their offering.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Iunius</hi> though hee thinke Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to bee the agent and worker of theſe aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſacrifices: yet for all that partly he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the working thereof to the time of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems beſieging. <hi>Impijs ſacrificium &amp; munus abolebit ex facto, quia premente obſidione vrbis destituentur commoditatibus ſacrificiorum.</hi> He ſhall aboliſh (ſayth <hi>Iunius,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt) ſacrifice and offering in regard of the wicked by deede, becauſe that the beſieging of the citie preſſing them, they ſhall bee bereaued of the profits of ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>This expoſition is not ſtrayned, it is plaine, without any wreſting, turning, adding, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away: the courſe of Heauen, and holy
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:9226:114"/>
Scripture, and prophane ſtorie, all make one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, they all agree in the ſame reckoning: if it bee not new, all is well. For this is well ſayde of an Hebrew writer, and worth the bearing in minde. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Better is the grape gleaning of the auncient, then the gathering of the later. Neither is it lightly to be regarded, which <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke againſt <hi>Apion</hi> affirmeth: that length of time is a moſt ſure proofe.</p>
               <p>For my owne part, I reuerence antiquities gray heares as much as any other, who beareth but this indifferencie to thinke that good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is aboue all. For without it I would not haue her contradicted.</p>
               <p>Wherefore leaſt this opinion of newneſſe diſcredite my iudgement: I am to let the reader vnderſtand, that though it be not ſo rife as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet it is more ancient then peraduenture may be thought. <hi>Tertullian</hi> was one of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Fathers moſt auncient, and very neere the Apoſtles, flouriſhing in the raigne of <hi>Seuerus</hi> the Emperor, about 200. yeares after Chriſtes birth, and not paſt one hundered after the death of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt. Who in a booke of his, written againſt the Iewes, expounding this prophecie of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes, beginneth the reckoning thereof from a <hi>Darius,</hi> which raigned nineteene yeares, after whome theſe foure ſucceeded one after another to the ende
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:9226:115"/>
of the Perſian Monarchie. Firſt <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> then <hi>Ochus,</hi> after him <hi>Arſes,</hi> and laſt of all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Darius,</hi> who was ouercome by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi> Whereby it is manifeſt that he meaneth the ſame <hi>Darius</hi> that I doe: for the beginning of this 490. yeares. Onely herein he was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that he ſuppoſed this <hi>Darius</hi> to be the ſame which is mentioned in the ninth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and raigned ouer the Medes, when this meſſage was brought vnto him by the Angell <hi>Gabriell.</hi> And for the ende thereof hee bringeth it to the firſt yeare of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>espaſian</hi> making this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all his account: <hi>Ita in diem expugnatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ſuae Iudaei impleuerunt hebdomadas 70. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictas in Daniele.</hi> So the Iews (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) at the daye of their ſubdewing fulfilled the 70. weekes foretolde by <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus for the Perſian king, vnder whom <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> weekes begun, there is no great difference betweene <hi>Tertullian</hi> and me: and for the time wherein they ended none at all.</p>

                  <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger</hi> in his 6 booke <hi>de emendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one temporum,</hi> acknowledgeth <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> to bee the Perſian king, by whoſe decree the building of the temple was reſtored.

               <p>Laſtly <hi>Iunius</hi> in the laſt edition of his bible, in his notes vpon the 9. of <hi>Daniell</hi> numbreth theſe 70. weekes, from the ſecond of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> to the ſecond of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> wherein <hi>Titus</hi> deſtroyed Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>Moreouer for the end of theſe weekes <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drinus</hi> was of the ſame iudgement, a man for great knowledge rare, and as anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if not more then <hi>Tertullian,</hi> whoſe neere

age to the apoſtles I haue ſpoken of before. He thought them to expire in the deſtruction of the citie by <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Origen</hi> in his 29. treatiſe vpon <hi>Mathew</hi> was of the ſame opinion, and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his 2. oration againſt the Iewes: To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Hebrew writers houlding the ſame, <hi>Aben Ezra, Iarchi</hi> and <hi>R.

               <p>And ſurely whoſoeuer readeth the place of <hi>Daniell</hi> with an euen minde, not preuented with preiudice, or blynded with affection: ſhall hardly find any other end wherin thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenets of yeares can ſettle their feete to reſt, for hauing deuided the whole 70. into 3. partes: firſt he ſheweth what was to be doone in ſeuen weekes, and then in 62. and laſtly in that one which was lefte after the 62. before the end whereof, he maketh mention of Meſſias to bee cut off, and the citie deſtroyed. If <hi>Daniel</hi> hauing propounded to himſelfe an exact and ſtraight order of weekes, ſhould firſt tell of Meſſias his cutting off in one weeke, and then of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and deſolation of Ieruſalem about 37 yeares after it, and then preſently come backe againe to the ſacrifices aboliſhed in the ſame weeke which he had ſpoken of before, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after go yet once againe to that deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which happened 40. yeares after verie
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:9226:117"/>
neere: it were a ſtrange kind of ridling, and farre more confuſe then the vaine oracles of Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos; eſpecially ſeeing that theſe clauſes and partes, are ioyned and knit together by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but copulatiue coniunctions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no maruell that thoſe excellent and worthie fathers, as well as the Hebrew ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſtes could finde no place by <hi>Daniels</hi> text for his weekes to ſtay in, but the ouerthrowe of the Iewes common wealth by the Romans.</p>
               <p>The end thus appearing by their teſtimonie, the beginning cannot bee hid. It muſt needs fall to the raigne of <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> where I ſet it.</p>
               <p>Hereby it appeareth, that this expoſition of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes by me brought, is neither new nor any ſingular deuiſe of my owne. I haue <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> and <hi>Theodoretus</hi> and <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and, <hi>R. Abraham</hi> in his cabbala, with other hebrew writers befornamed with me for the Meſſias cut off, to be vnderſtood of the gouenor of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>R. Leui</hi> alſo verie neere agreeing therunto: and differing onely in this, that in ſtead of the annointed princes vnderſtood of them by the name of Meſſias, he rather taketh the annointed prieſtes to be ment. Yea and that which is of farre greater force then all their authorities, the plaine teſtimonie of God his word which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth 7. weekes only to Meſſias and no more: as before I haue already proued by the original
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:9226:118"/>
text which if <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Theodoretus</hi> had throughly knowne, as the Hebrewes their part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in that iudgement did, they would haue ſtoutly ſtood for it againſt all the world.</p>
               <p>For the end of the weekes in the deſolation of the citie, <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Origen, Cryſoſtom, Sulpitius, Scaliger, Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> teſtifie with me. And 4. of them for both beginning and end agreeing or verie little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that though <hi>Ioſeph Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> referre the end of theſe weekes to the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the temple: yet he vnderſtandeth by the name of Meſſias in the 26 verſe, Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our redeemer to bee killed after 62. weekes, contayning yeares 434. And that theſe 434. yeares ended in the death of Chriſt, and begun in the 5. yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> wherein by a new decree, leaue was giuen to <hi>Eſdras</hi> the prieſt to returne with ſuch of his countriemen as would goe with him to Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>I am loth to ſpeake any thing without reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and loue of ſo excellent a man, who hath brought much light to the true vnderſtanding of this prophecie. This is all which I will ſay, that his opinion for this matter, wandreth far aſtray out of reaſons path. For how can this be proued that <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon</hi> gaue out any decree for <hi>Eſdras</hi> in the 5. of his raigne, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by prophane learning or diuine ſcripture?
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:9226:118"/>
It is ſayd in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> that hee went to Ieruſalem in the 7. yeare of that king. And therefore by the authoritie of that place skilfull men haue layde the foundation of <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeuenets in the 7. yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> How then is his fift yeare brought in for a new decree? <hi>Ab eo edic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ad perfectionem Eſdrae annus ſolidus interest.</hi> There was one whole yeare, ſayth <hi>Scaliger,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the decree and <hi>Eſdras</hi> his going. And what reaſon hath he for this? Surely none at all but this bare coniecture. <hi>Eo interuallo opus fuit Eſdrae ad reliquias Iudaeorum per Babiloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, Mediam, ac Perſidem ſparſas colligendas.</hi> That ſpace, ſayth he, was needfull for <hi>Eſdras</hi> to gather together ſuch Iewes as were left ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abroade, through Babylonia, Media, and Perſia.</p>
               <p>This is nothing els but a proofles conceipt: a fancie vnfit to build any credit or faith vpon. If ſuch kind of geſſing might ſtand for reaſon, it were a hundred fould more prone to bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that the decree was made preſently vpon his going in the verie ſame yeare, as <hi>Functius</hi> and other of the learned by vew of that ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue iudged. For what matter was it for ſo great a man of that eſtimation and honor that <hi>Eſdras</hi> was in, to gather 1500. ſpeedily toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Could it poſſibly take a yeares preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſuch a willing people of themſelues ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to go? Or if it were ſo great a matter and a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:9226:119"/>
worke of ſo long time, could ſo Godly and ſo zealous a prieſt be ſo negligent in the Lordes buſineſſe, that hauing a yeares warning to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little companie together, hee ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Leuites, which of al other were moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie in regard of Gods ſeruice in the temple of Ieruſalem? For when al were come together, no Leuit was found among them: the chiefeſt of all, in a whole yeares ſpace, were neuer thought vpon, till he was in ſome forwardneſſe on his way: then on a ſudden hee ſent to ſeeke for them. Read the 8. chapter of <hi>Eſdras</hi> the 15. verſe, and ſee how that which is there told can beare any ſuch coniecture.</p>
               <p>But to let that paſſe, it is not a yeares matter that can ſerue <hi>Ioſeph Scaligers</hi> turne, to helpe out his deuiſe, and to bring this geare about. For by the iudgement almoſt of all the beſt writers, by the ſpace of this twelue hundred yeares, our bleſſed Sauiour ſuffered toward the end of the laſt yeare of the 202. Olympiad: at which time was obſerued, euen by prophane Authors, the ſtrange eclipſe of the Sunne, which happened at the paſsion of Chriſt. <hi>Phlegon,</hi> by the iudgement of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> an excellent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of Olympiads, in his foureteenth book writeth thus. In the fourth yeare of the 202. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad was an exceeding great eclipſe of the Sunne, aboue all other that euer happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The day at the 6. houre, that is, high noone,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:9226:119"/>
was ſo turned into darke night, that the ſtarres were ſeene in heauen: and an Earthquake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew many houſes in Nice, a citie of Bythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Euſebius</hi> teſtifieth of <hi>Phlegon:</hi> and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth notably to the teſtimonie of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, touching the Sunnes darkening from the 6. houre to the 9. when Chriſt was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Thence therefore numbring backward 434. yeares, from the 202. Olympiad almoſt at an end, we come to the ſecond yeare of the 94 Olympiad drawing to an ende: at which time, euen by <hi>Scaligers</hi> own opinion, the third yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes Memor</hi> begun. By this meanes not one, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſayth, but foure full yeares at the leaſt: that is, the third, fourth, fift, and ſixt yeares of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſhould haue been betweene the decree and the going of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras</hi> to Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>I know that <hi>Scaliger</hi> putteth off the time of Chriſts paſſion a yeare further then other. But if that were granted him, yet ſhould the decree goe ful three yeares before <hi>Eſdras</hi> his comming to Ieruſalem. A thing vncredible and beyond all ſence of reaſon, that leaue ſhould be giuen <hi>Eſdras</hi> to goe to the houſe of God, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne decree by the kings authority publiſhed for it, and he linger and protract the time of his going three yeares after.</p>
               <p>Beſides, euen the Prophets owne words are
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:9226:120"/>
altogether againſt this interpretation of <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and will no wayes ſuffer it. For firſt hauing expounded the generall ſumme of 70. weekes for the ſtate of Ieruſalem, he deuideth them ſo into three parts, as that the firſt ſhould bee to the building of the walles and citie finiſhed, and then 62. for the continuing thereof ſo buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and after all them one more.</p>
               <p>Who hauing the reaſon of a man in him, can gather any other thing by <hi>Daniels</hi> words, but that thoſe 62. weekes ſpoken of, ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly follow after the firſt ſeuen, and goe next before the laſt one? Which being ſo, needes muſt they begin after the 32. of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and end ſeuen yeares before the vtter ruine of Ieruſalem, brought vpon it by <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is to be obſerued, that after the firſt ſeuen, ſet for the reſtoring and building of the citie, he ſayth, that the citie ſhould be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 62. weekes ſtreete and wall, and that after, not ſome other, but euen theſe very ſame 62. weekes before ſpoken of, ſhould Meſſias bee cut off and the citie made deſolate. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratiue article in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hath this force, to referre vs to a knowne thing ſpoken of: which is likewiſe vſuall in the Greeke tongue. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can <hi>Scaliger</hi> make of this, that Chriſt ſhould be killed after thoſe 62. weekes, wherein the citie of Ieruſalem continued builded ſtreet and wall? For it is well knowne that Ieruſalem
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:9226:120"/>
continued ſo builded ſtreete and wall aboue thirtie yeares after the paſſion of Chriſt, before it begun to bee made deſolate, and in all that time greatly flouriſhed. This interpretation therefore of <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath no ſucceſſe for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie.</p>
               <p>Another thing in <hi>Scaliger</hi> troubled me more then this: by reaſon of the excellencie of the man, not making any doubt of his account: <hi>Hebdomades incipientes ab edicto instaurandi templi deſinunt in initio abominationis, hoc eſt, circa initia belli Iudaici, quo primum caedes in vrbe patrari coeptae ac templum pollui: quod tempus incurrit in finem vndecimi &amp; initium duodecimi anni Neronis.</hi> The weekes (ſaith <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi>) beginning from the decree to reſtore the temple, doe end in the beginning of the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: that is, about the beginnings of the Iewes warre, when ſlaughters firſt begun to be committed in the citie, and the Temple to bee polluted: which time met with the end of the eleuenth and beginning of the twelfth yeare of <hi>Nero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſaying of <hi>Scaliger</hi> made mee maruell, till ſuch time as I made ſome doubt of his rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, and called it into queſtion. For if the 70. weekes of <hi>Daniel</hi> were (as hee ſayth) ended in the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi> his twelfth yeare; my account cannot poſſiblie ſtand, drawing them on further to the vtter deſtruction of the holie
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:9226:121"/>
citie by <hi>Titus,</hi> which happened foure yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This therefore is to be examined. <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> died a little before the end of the 93. Olympiad. This is agreed betweene vs, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the decree to his death, had paſſed ſeuenteene yeares, it is likewiſe agreed. For <hi>Scaliger</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the firſt ſeuen weekes, ſayth, that after the ſecond yeare of <hi>Darius,</hi> ſeuenteene yeares are left to the beginning of <hi>Artaxerxes Memor:</hi> whereunto 32. being added, the ſumme is 49. yeres, being the diſtance from the decree to the ſtreetes ordered.</p>
               <p>By this meanes the decree being made 17. yeares before the death of <hi>Darius,</hi> and that by his owne iudgement, muſt needes fall toward the end of the third yeare of the 89. Olympiad: from which time to the firſt yeare of the 212. Olympiad almoſt expired, when <hi>Titus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the ſuburbs of the citie, and battered the walles with his iron rammes about the 22. day of Aprill, as <hi>Paulus Eberus</hi> writeth in his Iewiſh ſtorie: about a fortnight after which time in the beginning of May, one of their wals was broken, and part of the citie entred and won, were full 490. yeares, and not 494. as <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligers</hi> deceitfull account would make it. <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> therefore rather prepared a way for others to come to the trueth, then came himſelfe vnto it: and gaue ſome light to other to ſee the right meaning of <hi>Daniels</hi> propheſie, which himſelfe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:9226:121"/>
neuer perfectly ſaw. By his helpe <hi>Junius</hi> ſawe ſomewhat more, and came neerer vnto it then he: yet ſo as he hath likewiſe done that for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which <hi>Scaliger</hi> did for him: that is, left ſomewhat behind to bee vnderſtood of other, which himſelfe neuer attained. Eſpecially in the 26. verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>that after thoſe</hi> 62. <hi>weekes Meſſias ſhall be cut off.</hi> Where Maſter <hi>Iunius</hi> vſeth ſome wreſting by turning the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tence into the preterperfect, and leauing out ſome coniunctions, and changing other: thereby making the accuſatiue caſe of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatiue, reiecting the ancient interpretations Greeke and Latin, without any cauſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe inconueniences they are of force dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto, who by the word <hi>Meſſias,</hi> doe not with <hi>Euſebius</hi> and the Hebrew expoſitors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the anointed gouernours. Some may here ſay vnto mee: Is it not plaine by the 24. verſe, that <hi>Daniel</hi> in this propheſie ſpeaketh of Ieſus Chriſt the redeemer of the worlde, of whoſe death ſo many ſingular and notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are declared therein: of aboliſhing ſinne, of reconciling ſinners vnto the fauour of God, and bringing euerlaſting righteouſneſſe, and fulfilling whatſoeuer had been foretold by the former Prophets of him? I anſwere to this, that of all other places in the old Teſtament touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the comming of Chriſt, whereof there is great ſtore, that verſe of <hi>Daniel</hi> is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:9226:122"/>
and cleere: yet withall I deny that by the name of Meſſias in the verſes following, Chriſt our Sauiour is vnderſtood. For neither the true account of yeares will ſuffer it, nor the text of holie Scripture beare it.</p>
               <p>But how then is it here ſayd, that 70. weekes were decreed for aboliſhing ſinne and making attonement, if Chriſt came not in the ende of thoſe 70. weekes? The meaning is, that within the ſpace of thoſe 70. weekes, Chriſt by his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould worke that redemption and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſinne and wrath to the world. As <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh in his booke againſt the Iewes: where writing of the paſſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt, he ſaith that it was perfected in the time of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar, Intra tempora ſeptuaginta hebdomadarum,</hi> within the times of the ſeuentie weekes.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that by the Hebrew wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it is a thing acknowledged and granted, that Chriſt came in the verie ende of thoſe weekes. For they held that their Meſſias ſhould begin to raigne at the deſtruction of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. And therefore <hi>Rabbi Leui ben Gerſhom</hi> expounding thoſe wordes of this text, <hi>to bring euerlasting righteouſneſse, and to ſeale vp viſion and prophet,</hi> referreth the fulfilling thereof to the kingdome of Chriſt, which hee calleth the fift kingdome, becauſe it was to ſucceede the other foure ſpoken of before in the ſecond and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:9226:122"/>
ſeuenth chapters of this propheſie.</p>
               <p>It was an olde tradition amongſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews of auncient time, receiued from the ſchoole of <hi>Elias,</hi> declared in their Talmud, in the treatiſe Sanhedrim the eleuenth chapter, and diuers other places, that the world ſhould endure ſixe thouſand yeres: whereof two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſhould bee voyd without the lawe, two thouſand vnder the law, and two thouſand the time of Chriſt. Whereby the iudgement ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth concerning the comming of Chriſt, that it ſhould be at the deſolation of the holie citie immediatly after the ceaſing of the law. For the law then ceaſed, and all the ceremonies thereof ended, when Ieruſalem, the ſeat of God his worſhip, according to that lawe, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by <hi>Titus,</hi> and neither place nor people there left anie longer for the law-ſeruice of God. Diuers ſuch teſtimonies of the auncient Hebrewes are recorded by <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Morney</hi> Lord of <hi>Pleſsie</hi> in his book of the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, the 29. and 30. chapters: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gathereth that it was a common opinion among them, that the Meſſias ſhould come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the deſtruction of the Temple. <hi>R. Hama</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hauina</hi> in the ſame chapter of the Talmudicall treatiſe before alleadged, ſayd, that the ſonne of <hi>David</hi> ſhould not come, ſo long as any ſoueraigne authoritie (were it neuer ſo ſmall) remained in Iſrael. Alſo <hi>R. Mili</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:9226:123"/>
                  <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Simeon,</hi> ſayd, that Chriſt ſhould not come vntill there were a cleane riddance of all Iudges &amp; Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in Iſrael. And <hi>R. Moſes Haddarſan</hi> vpon the 49. of Geneſis, gaue this iudgement of the Iewes Senate, conſiſting of ſeuentie Elders or Iudges called Sanhedrim; that they were not to ceaſe before the comming of the Meſſias. Let vs then examine when the authoritie of thoſe Iudges and all gouernment ceaſed in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, that thereby wee may know the time of Chriſt his comming by the Hebrew writers opinion. That honorable Lord of <hi>Pleſsie</hi> in his booke before mentioned, hauing cited the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of <hi>Philo</hi> in his booke of Times, to proue that <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew al the Sanhedrim about the 30. yeare of his raigne, affirmeth that to be the time wherein the ſoueraigntie and iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iuda did ceaſe: not for a few dayes or yeares, but for a continual time. How this may ſtand for trueth I cannot perceiue. For to ſay nothing of that fained <hi>Philo,</hi> an author forged in the ſhop of <hi>Annius</hi> his toying braine: it is well knowne that the common-wealth of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem and Iewrie flouriſhed with princely rule and other gouernment of Magiſtrates, yea of the very Sanhedrim themſelues, aboue three ſcore and ten yeares after that time, euen to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems deſolation. Chriſt in the 30. yeare of <hi>Herod</hi> was yet vnborne: who about the 33.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:9226:123"/>
yeare of his age, in the ſixteenth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> foretold to his Diſciples, what he was to ſuffer of the Elders and chiefe Prieſts and Scribes. All theſe were gouernours and rulers of the citie; and by the name of Elders, the beſt interpreters haue eſpecially vnderſtood thoſe Sanhedrim, hauing great reaſon for it. For theſe Sanhedrim were nothing els but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, 70. Elders of the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie or iudgemeat place in Ieruſalem. As by <hi>Elias Leuita</hi> they are deſcribed in his Tiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi. The old Rabbins in their Talmud haue bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Greeke tongue many words: whereof this worde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Sanhedrim is one, ſignifying a ſitting of Iudges or Senatours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in councell or iudgement. So it is taken in the 107. Pſalme the 32. verſe, by the Chaldie interpreter: where for theſe Hebrew wordes there vſed, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, Let them praiſe him in the ſitting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the wiſe: expreſsing the word of ſitting by Sanhedrim, as Synedrion in Greeke is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Chriſt therefore in the fift of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſaying, Whoſoeuer calleth his brother Raca, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhall be bound ouer to a ſeſsions or ſitting: meaneth the ſitting in iudgement of the Sanhedrim; applying his ſpeech to the manner of the ciuill iudgements
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:9226:124"/>
in Ieruſalem. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his 20. booke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities the eight chapter, telleth, that when <hi>Feſtus</hi> the Romane gouernour was dead, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the high prieſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, made the aſſemblie of the Iudges to ſit, by whom <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of Chriſt, was adiudged to be ſtoned. This happened vnder the gouernour <hi>Albinus,</hi> not long before the deſtruction of the citie. Whereby may bee gathered, that magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie, iudgement, and gouernment, yea the authoritie of the 70. Iudges called Sanhedrim; continued long after <hi>Herods</hi> 30. yere, and was not cut off, till the deſolation of Ieruſalem brought it to an end. For when the warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to worke the deſolation thereof then king <hi>Agrippa,</hi> by ſeditious rakehels, was driuen out of it: then were the Sanhedrim depoſed at the rebels will, and other baſe men ſet vp in their ſtead: as <hi>Joſephus</hi> telleth in the fift book of the Iewes warre the firſt chapter. Then was the Prieſthood and all good order made a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie. The rebellious cutters did what they liſt, no lawes to reſtraine them, no magiſtracie to puniſh them, no authoritie to bridle them. They ruled al at their own pleaſures themſelues as they would: good gouernment was turned into anarchie and diſorder, and Ieruſalem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> termeth it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a citie without a guide.</p>
               <p>And this it is that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth touching
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:9226:124"/>
Meſſias to bee cut off in the laſt weeke of the ſeuentie: meaning the rule and authoritie of the annointed gouernour, as before I haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the place. Thus by the iudgement of the Hebrew writers in their auncient monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the comming of Chriſt falleth to the fall of the Iewes common-wealth, in the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Ieruſalem, when gouernment and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ceaſed therein: which long before had been foretold by the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> in the 49. of Geneſis, in that old propheſie of his concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the comming of Chriſt: <hi>The ſcepter ſhall not depart from Iuda, nor a law giuer from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his feete till Shiloh come: and him ſhall the people gather themſelues vnto.</hi> For together with this diuine oracle of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that other moſt ancient and excellent propheſie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> hitherto not perfectly and cleerely, according to the true meaning therof, declared of any that I know of, may receiue light.</p>
               <p>Many haue ſought the fulfilling of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in the firſt comming of Chriſt at his birth: but without ſtraying it could neuer yet be there found. For the meaning of it was, that in the tribe of Iuda ſhould bee royall ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Magiſtrates, for the good of the Iewes, &amp; vpholding of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, till the comming of Chriſt: whoſe new ſpirituall raigne, by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſhould aboliſh their old earthly kingdome
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:9226:125"/>
and outward policie. So was the place vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Hebrew Doctors aforenamed, <hi>R. Hama, R. Mili, R. Eliezer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chaldie paraphraſts both of them moſt excellently expound the place, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnderſtood not: being like therein vnto <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgils</hi> Bees, which make honey for other, and not themſelues. Firſt <hi>Onchelos</hi> interpreteth it in this manner; A Magiſtrate exerciſing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the houſe of Iuda ſhall not depart, nor a Scribe of his poſteritie for euer, till Chriſt come, to whom the kingdome pertaineth, and him ſhall the people obey. The other called the interpreter of Ieruſalem, thus: Kings of the houſe of Iuda ſhall not faile, neither skilful law-teachers of his poſteritie, vnto the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the king Chriſt ſhall come: vnto whom the kingdome pertaineth, and all the kingdomes of the earth ſhall be ſubdued vnto him. If Chriſt came when authoritie was gone, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie went away at Ieruſalems fall: needes muſt one comming of Chriſt bee referred to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of that citie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. Moſes</hi> of Tyroll &amp; <hi>Bioces</hi> looked for the comming of Chriſt towards the end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple: being led thereunto partly by their owne reckoning vpon <hi>Daniel,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a text in the laſt chapter of the prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> the ſeuenth verſe: where it is ſayd, Before her throwes came vpon her ſhe was deliuered
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:9226:125"/>
of a manchilde. Some of the Rabbines ſayd, Meſſias was borne the very ſame day that the ſecond temple was deſtroyed in: ſuppoſing that ſcripture of <hi>Eſay</hi> to be therein fulfilled. In their book called Bereſhith Rabba, is read this parable: As a certaine Iew was at plow, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian paſsing by hearing one of his oxen low, bad him vnyoke, becauſe the deſtruction of the Temple was at hand. And by and by hearing alſo the other low, bad him vnyoke out of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, becauſe the Meſsias was alreadie come. <hi>R. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> in another place telling the ſame: What neede we (ſaith he) to learne it of the Arabians, ſeeing the text it ſelfe declareth it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in the ſeuenth booke of the Iewes warre, the twelfth chapter, writeth, that in the holie Scripture was found an olde propheſie, that at the time of the ouerthrow of Ieruſalem, a king ſhould come out of Iewrie, who ſhould raigne ouer all the world: which he by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring falſhood, interpreted of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpaſian.</hi> This propheſie in thoſe daies was bruted abroad in many mens mouthes euery where: yea, ſome write that it was engrauen in an open place of the caſtle at Ieruſalem: which (as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) made the Iewes at that time ſo readie to rebell. And this was the cauſe that ſo many fained themſelues to be the Meſsias about that time of the deſtruction of the Temple. Vnder <hi>Cuſpius Fadus,</hi> one <hi>Theudas</hi> a iugler made the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:9226:126"/>
people beleeue that he was a prophet, &amp; would deuide the waters of Iordan that they ſhould goe ouer drie, as they had done long before mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly, in the time of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> by the power of God. And when <hi>Felix</hi> was the Romane go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Iudea, one comming out of Egypt, fayning himſelfe to bee a prophet, perſwaded the people if they would follow him to mount Oliuet, they ſhould ſee the walles of Ieruſalem fall downe. And afterward one <hi>Barcozba,</hi> ſo called of his lying, tooke vpon him to bee the Meſsias, and ſeduced many: but in the end per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming not the deliuerance looked for at his hands, he was knocked on the head for his ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſlaine.</p>
               <p>All theſe tooke aduantage of the time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwerable to their intent, and of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples diſpoſition, then looking for their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt. Moreouer, there was yet another propheſie bruted amongſt them, that Doctor <hi>Hillels</hi> ſchollers ſhould neuer faile till Chriſt were come. The youngeſt of them was <hi>R. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaman</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> who liued to ſee the deſtruction of the Temple: and alſo the miracle of a great gate thereof, a little before opening of it ſelfe: which <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſpeaketh of in his ſeuenth booke and twelfth chapter of the Iewes warre: Whereat this <hi>R. Iochaman</hi> being amazed, remembred this ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi> in the beginning of his 11. chapter:
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:9226:126"/>
                  <hi>Open thy gates O Libanus, and let fire conſume thy cedars:</hi> applying the place to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Furthermore they had amongſt them theſe olde traditions touching the tokens of Chriſtes comming. When Chriſt the ſonne of <hi>Dauid</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, ſayth <hi>R. Iudas,</hi> there ſhall be few wiſe men in Iſraell, and the wiſdome of the ſcribes ſhall ſtinke, and the ſchooles of diuinitie ſhall become brothelhouſes. <hi>R. Nehorai</hi> ſayd that good men in Iſraell ſhould bee abhorred, and mens countenaunces paſt ſhame at Chriſtes comming. And <hi>R. Nehemias</hi> ſayd, that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe ſhould bee multiplied without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and nothing but vnto wardneſſe and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiſme</hi> amongſt them. VVhat is this els but that ouerſpreading of abominations which <hi>Daniell</hi> foretelleth ſhould be in thoſe times of the deſolation of Ieruſalem? which is declared as large by <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> pointing out the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doings of the Iewes at that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt nature, and all law of God and man. The religious and holy places (ſayth <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi>) were defiled by the vncleane feete of wicked men: The temple of God was held and kept as a tower of defence againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the ſeditious rebels: the holy ground was ſprinkled with the blood of wounded men, contrarie to Gods lawe entering thereunto: ſtrangers and towne-borne, prophane and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:9226:127"/>
were mingled together: and the blood of diuers men being ſlayne, made a poole in the courtes of the Lords houſe. They abuſed the diuine veſſels, annointed themſelues with the holy oyle, drunke of the conſecrate wine. In euerie place of the citie was ſpoyling and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie. Burning with luſt they forced women in moſt filthy and abominable manner for their pleaſure, liuing in Ieruſalem as a ſtewes or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelhouſe. At this their extreame wickedneſſe God was offended: and abhorred his citie, and deteſted his temple.</p>
               <p>All this <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifieth in diuers places. And in the 2. chapter of his 5. booke of the Iewes warre. All law of God and man (ſayth he) was troden vnder foote and derided. The holy oracles of the prophets were counted no better then common fables and tales. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of the decrees their forfathers touching vice and vertue, by the euent they verified thoſe thinges which long before had beene foretold of their countrie. For an ould prophecie, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> witneſſeth, went abrode, that then the citie ſhould bee taken, and the temple burnt: when ſedition ſhould ariſe amongſt them, and their own handes firſt defile God his ſanctuarie.</p>
               <p>Thus doe <hi>Ioſephus</hi> &amp; <hi>Daniel</hi> refer the raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ouerflowing abhominations of the Iewes, to the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, which the Hebrew Rabbines applied to the comming
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:9226:127"/>
of Chriſt: So that is prooued true which the Lorde of Pleſſie in his booke aforenamed affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that it was a common opinion among the Iewes for their Meſſias to come about the deſtruction of the Temple, which for any thing that I can ſee to the contrarie, may in ſome ſort not without reaſon bee yeelded vnto: For two commings of Chriſt are declared in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The firſt in humilitie ſpoken of by <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> in his ninth Chapter. Reioyce greatly Oh daughter of Sion, bee glad O daughter of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, for loe thy king commeth vnto thee, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the righteous and Sauiour, lowlie and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ryding vpon an Aſſe and a coult the fole of an Aſſe. The other in glorie wherein Chriſt came in his kingdome: whereof we read in the ſixteene chapter of <hi>Mathew</hi> the laſt verſe. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie I ſay vnto you, there be ſome of them that ſtand heere, which ſhall not taſte of death till they haue ſeene the ſonne of man come in his kingdome, and before in the tenth chapter of the ſome Euangeliſt. You ſhall not finiſh all the Cities of Iſrael till the ſonne of man be come. And in the twentie one chapter of <hi>Iohn.</hi> If I will that hee tarrie till I come, what is that to thee? whereof this word went abroad that this Diſciple ſhould not die.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſpeeches our Sauiour Chriſt vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red being once come alreadie, &amp; after his firſt comming: wherefore that an other ſecond
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:9226:128"/>
comming of his therein is to be vnderſtood, is ſo cleare &amp; manifeſt, that it need not bee ſtood vpon: which in my iudgement can not to anie time more fitly agree, then that wherein the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Ieruſalem with the holie Temple of God therein was deſtroyed, according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Hebrewes before declared. Then Chriſt our Lord firſt begun to appeare a reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging iudge againſt the wicked and ſtubborne Iewes, in puniſhing them for their malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him at his death, and cruell perſecution of his Church afterward, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> declareth in the third booke of his eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, the fift chapter.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Iunius,</hi> in his annotations on this ninth Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> expounding thoſe wordes: From the going forth of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to reſtore and build Ieruſalem vnto Chriſt, ſhall be ſeuen weekes, and threeſcore &amp; two weekes; referreth them to the comming of Chriſt, and that comming of Chriſt, to the laſt of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes, wherein the deſolation of Ieruſalem began, yeelding this reaſon: becauſe then Chriſt declared himſelfe a Lord by a moſt ſeuere iudgement againſt Ieruſalem and the Iewes, and by the benefit of the Goſpell a Prince and head of the Church, which raigneth in the houſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> for euer.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Caluin</hi> in his harmonie acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that by the iudgement of ſome expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:9226:128"/>
that place in the tenth of <hi>Mathew,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the deſolation of the holie Citie made by the Romans. In the 24. chapter of <hi>Mathew,</hi> when Chriſt vpon the Diſciples prayſing of the glorious building of the Temple, had ſpoken of the deſtruction thereof to come, wherein one ſtone ſhould not bee left vpon another. They asked him when thoſe thinges ſhould bee, and what ſigne ſhould bee of his comming, and of the end of the world, ioyning theſe three things together, the deſolation of the Temple, the comming of Chriſt, and the end of the world, as it were all pertayning to one time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for that which is asked in <hi>Mathew</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſigne of Chriſts comming, and the end of the worlde: in the other two Euangeliſtes <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> this only is demanded, what ſigne ſhould be of the deſtruction of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Temple in Ieruſalem: wherby may bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that the Apoſtles of Chriſt held the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the olde Hebrewes concerning the comming of Chriſt at the deſolation of the Temple, and therein a change of the world: for after that the ſtate of the old Church ſhould be once ouerthrowne, the ancient Hebrewes loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for a new worlde, as it were by the new raigne of their Meſſias, which in their writings they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, the world to come, vnderſtanding therby the time of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:9226:129"/>This appeareth in the Chaldie paraphraſis of <hi>Ionathas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Vzziell</hi> in the firſt of kinges the fourth chapter and 32. verſe, where he calleth the daies of Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">

The Diſciples then asking what ſhould bee the ſigne of Chriſts comming and the end of the world, may ſeeme to haue thought the verie ſame, and vnderſtoode the ſame world which ended at the comming of Meſſias to raigne in a new world by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and for this cauſe thoſe times betweene the preaching of Chriſt and Ieruſalem deſtroyed, were called the laſt dayes in the ſecond chapter of the Actes of the Apoſtles the 17. verſe.

Theſe things (ſaith he) were writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh vs, vpon whome the ends of the world are come, and in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes the ninth chapter, and twentie ſixe verſe. Now in the end of the world hath Chriſt appeared once to put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. That which <hi>R. Nehemias</hi> ſaid of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be multiplied againſt the comming of Chriſt, is it not in plaine wordes verified by Chriſt himſelfe in the verie ſame twenty foure Chapter of <hi>Mathew</hi> the twelft verſe, giuing this for one token of his comming and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of Ieruſalem to be at hand, that iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould abound and charitie wax cold? If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny here demaund, how the ſecond comming of Chriſt can be with any reaſon referred to the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, ſeeing that it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by that verie ſame twentie foure chapter of <hi>Mathew,</hi> that the comming of Chriſt to iudgement at the latter day is there deſcribed, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuddennes therof, by his appearing in the clouds, the gathering of the elect with the ſound of a trumpet, by the doome of the iudge decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the next chapter, where the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is continued. Come yee bleſſed of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherit yee the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world: depart yee

curſed into euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the diuel &amp; his angels. I anſwere that the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt containeth his whole raigne, iuriſdiction, and iudgement, in the Citie of God the heauenly Ieruſalem by the goſpel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deſolation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward &amp; earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ieruſalem when it begun, to the end of the world at the reſurrection of all fleſh: ſo that the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, and the latter doome, being both included within the time of Chriſts ſecond comming: there is no let but that the comming of Chriſt may be referred to both: to one in regard of the beginning, to the other in regard of the end and conſummation thereof. And this is the cauſe that Chriſt there ſpeaking of his ſecond comming, blendeth theſe two together, the deſolation of Ieruſalem and his laſt iudgement, becauſe both pertained to one and the ſame kingdome of Chriſt. And hereof it is that reſpecting the beginning of that kingdome, in the deſtruction of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, wherein hee firſt appeared a rauenging iudge, hee ſaith, that that generation ſhould not paſſe till all thoſe thinges were fulfilled. All one with that in the end of the ſixteene chapter of the ſame Goſpel. Verily I ſay vnto you, ſome of them that ſtand here ſhall not taſte of death, till they haue ſeene the ſonne of man come in his kingdome. What time was there more fit for an other comming of Chriſt to fall vnto
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:9226:130"/>
within one generation from thoſe wordes by him vttered a little before his death then this? what time more agreeable to that, which after his reſurrection hee ſpake of <hi>Iohns</hi> tarrying till he came, then the downefall of the Iewes eſtate and the vtter deſolation of their Citie, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, which that Euangeliſt liued to ſee? It is not vnlike or diſagreeing to reaſon, that then ſhould begin the ſpirituall raigne of Chriſt ouer all Nations by the preaching of the Goſpell; when the doctrine of the law with all the ceremonies thereof were vtterly aboliſhed. That then ſhuld begin the heauenly kingdome of Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earthly kingdom of the Iewes, and all their law gouernment was firſt extinct. That then ſhould begin the inward ſubiection of Gods newe people the elect amongſt the Gentiles, and the ſpirituall ſeruice of GOD, when the Iewes outward worſhip had ceaſed. That then ſhould begin the ſpirituall Sion and new Ieruſalem from heauen, when the earthly Sion and olde Ieruſalem had no more being. According to the ſaying of <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet in his ſecond chapter: <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt daies, that the mountaine of the Lords houſe ſhall be prepared in the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and ſhall be exalted aboue the hils, and all nations ſhall flow vnto it. And many people ſhall goe, and ſay, Come, let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:9226:131"/>
of Iacob, and he will teach vs his wayes, and we will walke in his paths: for the Law ſhall goe forth of Sion, and the word of the Lord from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> Where, by the high mountaine of the Lords houſe, and the names of Sion and Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, is vnderſtoode not any certaine earthly place, or materiall citie: but the Church of Chriſt ruled and guided by the preaching of the Goſpell. Which the Apoſtle in the fourth chapter of the epiſtle to the Galathians, calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: that is, high Ieruſalem, or Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem which is aboue. Alluding to the former propheſie of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and oppoſing the high Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem to the earthly and materiall Ieruſalem, which begot children of bondage by the law like <hi>Agar,</hi> and mount Sinai there called the new Ieruſalem, or Ieruſalem that now is. For as there were two kinds of Iewes, ſpoken of by <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Romanes the ſecond chapter, one viſible, the other ſecret: ſo there were two Ieruſalems, one outward by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ceremonies of the Law: the other in ward by the ſpirituall graces of the Goſpell, which is Chriſt his Church termed the heauenly Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes the twelfth chapter and 22. verſe. This heauenly Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem then begun when the earthly Ieruſalem was brought to an end, being deſtroyed by the Romane armie and conſumed by fire, and the Iewes led captiue and diſperſed abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:9226:131"/>The preaching of the goſpel begun long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deſtruction of Ieruſalem I confeſſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Chriſt himſelfe while he liued: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewed after by the apoſtles for the ſpace of 40. yeares. All this is true. Yet ſo as withall the outward and ciuill gouernement of the Iewes common wealth with their ceremoniall ſeruice and law worſhip remayned ſtill all that while in the holy citie and temple of God. And therefore that preaching of Chriſt and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſo long before, ſeemed rather a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this kingdome of Chriſt, then any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beginning thereof. According to that manner of preaching vſed by Chriſt and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of his apoſtles:<note place="margin">Mat. 4.17. Mat. 10.7.</note> repent for the kingdome of God is at hand. Meaning that Chriſt in his kingdome was ſhortly to come, euen before they ſhould haue gone preaching throughout all the cities of Iſraell: as he telleth them after in the ſame chapter. Then was the full and cleare beginning of the new ſpirituall raigne of Chriſt ouer God his people: when the olde gouernement and outward ſeruice had wholly giuen place vnto it: when Chriſt raigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in God his church by his goſpell without any fellowſhip or part taking with the law ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For thoſe 2. at one time could not ſtand together to be both of force. In this reſpect that which was ſayd touching Chriſt in the 24. ver. of ending ſinne and making attonement, may
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:9226:132"/>
be applied to this time: bycauſe that although thoſe thinges were performed before: yet then eſpecially, and by a kind of excellencie Chriſt ſanctified his church from ſinne, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſinners into God his fauour: when he did it alone, all the partes of the lawe therein being ended. VVhen Chriſt by his goſpel without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more law-purifyings &amp; oblations was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe all in all. When the ſhadow was gone and the body come into the place of it. That alſo of the comming of euerlaſting righteouſneſſe, which may be vnderſtood of Chriſt Ieſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being called our righteouſneſſe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Ieremie</hi> the 23. chapter, and the firſt epiſtle to the Corinth. the firſt chap. doth well agree to the beginning of his raigne, whereunto his comming by the Hebrew writers eſpecially it is referred. And the ſealing of viſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſo agreeable likewiſe vnto it, as I ſe not how it could be fulfilled before. For amongſt manie other thinges foretold of Chriſt by the prophets in former ages: his glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was one. The time whereof euen by Chriſt him ſelfe in many ſpeeches is ſet within one generation after his death: and therefore viſion and prophecie was not fully &amp; abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before that time performed. Laſtly the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of the holy of holies being a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of conſecrating kinges to their raigne of all other for the beginning of Chriſtes kingdome
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:9226:132"/>
is moſt fit. Thus wee ſee that opinion of the Hebrewes, concerning the fulfilling of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie in the comming of Chriſt to raigne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the end of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes in the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Ieruſalem not to be altogether ſtrange or abſurd, hauing ſome motiues from holy ſcripture to perſwade vs thereto. But it is not my mind to vrge or preſſe any man further for the receauing or holding thereof then it ſhall ſeeme good in his own iudgement to approue. If any thinke rather that other comming of Chriſt in this place to bee vnderſtood: that is, ſome part of the time wherein hee was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with men vppon earth, from his birth to his death, it may ſtand wel enough in that ſence which before I haue declared.</p>
               <p>Thus by God his mercie I haue, according to my poore talent, declared my iudgement for the true vnderſtanding of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes by interpretation of his wordes, and account of the times. The beginning of the 55.
